            <title>Big Ripsaw and Crosscut Saw Project by Dominic Greco</title>
            <description>I wanted to build a full sized rip and crosscut saws for a while now. Until recently I didn&apos;t have access to large widths of 0.042&quot; steel. But that changed and I was ready to work.&lt;br /&gt;
Along with that steel I also picked up a Beverly Slitting Shear. This little gem allows me to cut spring steel like it was paper. Now that all the pieces were in place I decided it was time to layout a rip and cross cut saw prototype. I used AutoCad to design the saw plates to meet the hang line of a couple of my favorite saw handles - the Wheeler Madden &amp; Clemson as well as the old Disston D-7. Once I had these laid out I printed out the plans and went to town on the saw plates.

            <title>Building a Minstrel Banjo with Jason Stamper</title>
            <description>A few years ago I was camping with a friend of mine and he brought his minstrel banjo. After getting to play it I knew I had to have one, but funds were short. &lt;br /&gt;
So being the practical one, I decided to make one. My friend said I was nuts for trying since I could buy one for $200, but I decided to forge ahead anyway.</description>

            <title>Plane Maker’s Bed Float Reproduction by Jim Hendricks</title>
            <description>Part war of attrition... part friendship... and mostly encouragement was all I needed to get my backside out into the shop again and make a prototype tool… as suggested by a very good friend of mine Toby Nava.&lt;br /&gt;
So having absolutely no idea where to start a few more head scratchings and observations of other fine tools led me to make one… and by chance one for me too! (how clever was that!!)&lt;br /&gt;
Steel….O1... of course... 3mm ground gauge plate&lt;br /&gt;
Toby requested 6 1/2&quot; of tooth area and a total length of 8&quot; so that’s the dimensions. In retrospect... and if I ever make another..</description>

            <title>The Plot Thickens – The Berg Hand Tools Revisited by Kim Malmberg</title>
            <description>I have written several stories about the Erik Anton Berg manufacturing company. Mostly I have been engaged in trying to date company line of tools depending on stamps and logotypes.&lt;br /&gt;
Much new and hard evidence had surfaced since the previous stories, which has effectively crushed several loose theories. Which is all good. &lt;br /&gt;
This particular story will not be so much about the type study or dating Berg tools, as it is about the new findings which have occurred, very much regardless of my work, but through evidence brought forward by people such as my good friend Glen Crook in Canada, author of the website Galootopia, Randall Nelson, a collector of unusual chisels, but also through the Facebook group Gamla verktyg and the detective work by Fredrik Dahlstedt.</description>

            <title>Hand Plane Basics - part 1 by Bill Rittner</title>
            <description>I am often asked how to get started using handplanes. So, here goes.  &lt;br /&gt;
I chose the plane pictured below for this article because it is common and inexpensive. It is a modern Stanley #5 jack plane made in England. I bought it at a flea market for $7. &lt;br /&gt;
My purpose is to show you that just about any plane can be made to work well with some knowledge and work. The object of this article will be to make this plane work well not to make it look pretty.</description>

            <title>Making the Ron Herman&apos;s Sawbench by Naveen Gogineni</title>
            <description>The first time I ever heard of a saw bench was from a Chris Schwarz article on Popular Woodworking.  The one in the pdf in the article was an intimidating one for me because of the mortise &amp; tenon joints etc. &lt;br /&gt;
After doing a bunch of research I came across another saw bench, again by C. S., but with &quot;easier&quot; joints. &lt;br /&gt;
I&apos;ve been using that bench for many months now and I completely agree with Chris&apos;s statement that using a handsaw without a saw bench is like trying to use a router without securing your work. You can do it in a pinch, but your results usually suffer.</description>

            <title>Sorby: A Famous Sheffield Tool Making Family by Geoffrey Tweedale</title>
            <description>‘SORBY’ is a well-known name in Sheffield tool and cutlery manufacture.&lt;br /&gt;
The family was an old one, whose members became prominent in the town’s affairs as magistrates and local government officials. The first Master Cutler (the head of the local craft guild) in 1624 was Robert Soresby (the name has had various spellings). Other Sorbys later held that post. &lt;br /&gt;
By the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, several Sorby tool and cutlery businesses thrived in Sheffield. Their history is featured in tool reference books, on internet sites, and in company literature. &lt;br /&gt;
Much has been made of the family’s ancient links to the first Master Cutler, its worthy municipal record, its illustrious descendants (one of them was the scientist, Henry Clifton Sorby), and the longevity of its industrial activities.&lt;br /&gt;
Unfortunately, that reported history is incomplete. Moreover, the complex family and inter-firm linkages have bred endless confusion. Sorby’s business history therefore merits further investigation.</description>

            <title>Warran &amp; Ted demands some respect - II by Kim Malmberg</title>
            <description>This is a Warranted Superior hand saw. Nevertheless I will boldly state that it is one of the finest saws I have ever come across.&lt;br /&gt;
I cannot confirm the maker with absolute certainty, but the saw features a Warranted Superior medallion with the Disston keystone, so I’d be surprised if it was made by any other company.&lt;br /&gt;
Bear with me. The etch in my Supplee Hardware saw contains two rows of text identical, both in content and design, to a Woodrough McParlin hardware saw made for Sickels &amp; Nutting in Davenport, Iowa.</description>

            <title>Isaac Youngs Wall Clock  by Will Myers</title>
            <description>The Isaac Youngs wall clock is a decidedly timeless piece.&lt;br /&gt;
The original clock, made by Youngs in the 1840 is in the collection of Hancock Shaker Village, Hancock Mass. Even though time seems to be my worst enemy these days, I thought I would have a go at making one. &lt;br /&gt;
The overall measurements I used for this clock came from Ejner Handberg’s second volume of Shop Drawings of Shaker Furniture and Woodenware. Mr. Handberg’s dimensions were documented from the original clock.</description>

            <title>Rosewood Tote Repair Step by Step by Dominic Greco</title>
            <description>I used a couple small pieces of rosewood to repair this rosewood tote.&lt;br /&gt;
Now before you ask, &quot;Why go through all this mess? Just make a new one!&quot;, I&apos;ll give you my reasons.&lt;br /&gt;
First off, I really don&apos;t like making totes. 
I can shape them pretty easily, but I consistently mess up the drilling for the counter bore at the top. The only way I can see to make it full proof is to buy a counterbore bit.</description>

            <title>James Howarth &amp; Sons Ltd. by Geoffrey Tweedale</title>
            <description>James Howarth (1811-1891) was the son of William Howarth, an edge tool maker, and his wife, Hannah. James’ uncle, John, had been involved in Mottram &amp; Howarth, an edge tool manufacturer, which had been listed in a directory in 1811 in Bridge Street.&lt;br /&gt;
In 1823, James had joined his father as a 12-year-old second hand or striker (forger) at another edge tool maker, Mitchell Bros, in Furnival Street. James ‘soon learned how to make a good chisel … and by the time he reached the age of 22 he had gained so much of the confidence of his employers that he was entrusted with the duties of manager’ (Sheffield Independent, 31 July 1891).</description>

            <title>Make a Tote by Bill Rittner</title>
            <description>I have been making replacement knobs and totes for planes for a number of years and through this article hope to pass on some of the knowledge I have gained over that time. Making a new tote is not too difficult for the average woodworker, but explaining the entire process is rather complicated. &lt;br /&gt;
So I have chosen to break this article up into several parts to make it easier to digest.</description>

            <title>Spot the Fake by Kim Malmberg</title>
            <description>I love hand saws. All of them.&lt;br /&gt;
In any shape and size. Since woodworking in my case is merely an excuse for dealing with rust I tend to spend most of my shop time working on saws, rather than with them. &lt;br /&gt;
Where I live I can rarely find any decent saws. Most of them are badly beaten with ugly or broken handles and damaged saw plates. Which means I have a stack of donor saws where one can provide a plate...</description>

            <title>Reviving a Traditional Tool Chest by Jason Stamper</title>
            <description>A few years ago I bought and read Chris Schwarz’s book “The Anarchists Tool Chest.” When I found this book I was in the process of making a tool box with a lift up front. Even as I was making this toolbox, I realized it would end up being far too small for my burgeoning tool collection.&lt;br /&gt;
After reading the book and thinking about it, I decided I would need to build my own tool chest. At this point I stopped working on the first toolbox, it’s still not finished, and started planning for the larger tool chest. As fate would have it I discovered a very heavy antique tool chest at my favorite rusty iron dealer. I talked him down to $60, and loaded it in the back of our Explorer; along with the two panel saws I bought that day. As I have often jokingly told my dear wife, I have an iron deficiency.</description>

            <description>A Roubo Bookstand is made from a single piece of wood.&lt;br /&gt;
It opens as pictured or folds flat. The design is actually much older than Andre Roubo (he wrote in the 1770s), it is a traditional form for supporting the family Quran. Searching the Internet for “Roubo Bookstand” will keep you busy for many hours.</description>

            <title>Re-cutting and Re-sizing Saw Teeth with Paul Sellers</title>
            <description>No matter the reason, this video show you how simple it is to cut new saw teeth in any handsaw. &lt;br /&gt;
Yes, that means from small dovetail saws to the largest hand saws you have. If you have a saw you ruined, then file off the teeth and reach for your junior hacksaw. You are on your way to a saw tooth re-cut you won&apos;t regret no matter the maker old and new. &lt;br /&gt;
I so hope you enjoy the work that went into this and that you like what I have done to reach out to real woodworkers around the world.</description>

            <title>Testing the “Richard Tomes” Memorial Infill Panel Plane by Jim Hendricks</title>
            <description>This week I finally had opportunity to get the plane tested by Douglas Coates of Coats England who is not only one of this country’s fine craftsmen in wood… but a good friend and a very honest critic of things wood in general, so I knew his views during testing would not be sugar coated!&lt;br /&gt;
His workshop in the heart of Sevenoaks is ideal for the test because it’s a “proper” workshop... unlike mine which is more akin to the set of Steptoe and Son!</description>

            <description>I have always been a good guitar player and it is my favorite instrument to play, so I decided to go for a 19th century parlor guitar.&lt;br /&gt;
The guitar is far more complex than the early banjo, but I was determined to give it a try. &lt;br /&gt;
This instrument is being based on a Martin 1-18 guitar plan, and is very small compared to a modern guitar.</description>

The fact that I prefer to work in wood had not escaped Richard’s keen eye… and also that I admired his wonderful work with creating dovetails in steel and anyone who has successfully done so in wood will know that doing this with steel is nothing short of alchemy!</description>

            <title>The Eleven Grooved Box – Tools Update by Jim Harvey</title>
            <description>I have an improved fixture for making Eleven Grooved Box splines. 

Roy Underhill’s video shows the spline blank placed in a grooved block. Then the blank is planed to size with a block plane.&lt;br /&gt;
The problem is, this eventually cuts some off the top surface of the grooved block causing the splines to come out too small. Then the splines won’t do their job well and look terrible.&lt;br /&gt;
My improved method has three secret weapons:&lt;br /&gt;
1. A Kerfing Plane to make the blanks&lt;br /&gt;
2. A modified Dado plane with skewed blade&lt;br /&gt;
3. A sizing block with a channel to guide the modified plane</description>

            <title>Building a Stair Saw by Dominic Greco</title>
            <description>I just started working on a new project in which I will build a stair saw based on an old Disston Stair saw loaned to me by Buckaroo. &lt;br /&gt;
I drew up the profile and made myself a temple of the handle. I also took the time to draw up a profile of the saw plate and get it&apos;s measurements down.&lt;br /&gt;
I used a caliper to measure the thickness of the sawplate and was sort of surprised to find that it was 0.032&quot; thk.&lt;br /&gt;
But I guess this would stand to reason since you would want a stiff saw plate for cuts where it was extended away from the handle.&lt;br /&gt;
Before really digging into the building process, I like to get all the raw material together and cut to rough size. Tonight I started on the saw plate.</description>

            <description>I have a great affection for hand drills. I own about 20 working models from mainly Goodell-Pratt and Millers Falls.&lt;br /&gt;
I really like the G-P hand drills. They are beautiful, and there&apos;s a sea of models to choose from. A very nice detail is that several G-P hand drill models are of the same size and were made with removable handles.</description>

            <title>Ratcheting Parallel Guide and Angled Leg Vises by Will Myers</title>
            <description>In Scott Landis’s &quot;The Work Bench Book&quot; there is a drawing of a ratchet mechanism
for a parallel guide.&lt;br /&gt;
It was one of those little tidbits I tend to file away in my head thinking I might try sometime. &lt;br /&gt;
In the book the guide is a solid piece of iron with teeth cut in the lower side that engage a plate mounted to the leg of the bench. &lt;br /&gt;
A simple foot lever arrangement raises the guide above the plate when you need to close up the chop of the vise.</description>

            <title>Coffeyville Kansas Patented Oiler Discovered in Oklahoma by Michael Urness</title>
            <description>Several years ago, while attending the SWTCA tool show in Tulsa Oklahoma, I had the good fortune to spend a few hours visiting with Tim Hoss, the show&apos;s host.&lt;br /&gt;
The day before the show started, Tim took me to his house to show me the progress being made on its remodeling. After walking thru the house, we retired to the garage where Tim&apos;s tools are temporarily being housed.&lt;br /&gt;
In one of the totes of planes was an Ohio Tool Co. No. 04 smooth plane that has a brass front knob. It didn&apos;t look like anything special. In fact it is a plane that I and many other tool collectors might have walked past if we had seen it on a table at a tool show.</description>

            <title>British Saws and Saw Makers from 1660 by Simon Barley</title>
            <description>My affair with English saws began a long time ago. Sometime around 1998 I met Ken Hawley  at his delectable tool shop in central Sheffield, renowned as the place that announced in the window &quot;We sell nowt [in local dialect &quot;nothing&quot;] but tools&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
Most of what I got there was new tools, but I also acquired from him the first set of hollows and rounds that helped me to get started on using moulding planes. I was by then several years into a major project of converting a 19th century stone barn into a house, and was more and more fascinated by the wonderful tools I could use – machinery frightened me, it made a terrible noise and dust, and it did not enable me to learn the feeling of the timber as I worked it.</description>

            <title>Saw Sharpening Bench by Bill Rittner</title>
            <description>For shop projects I don’t usually buy the materials, but try to use what I have, what I can repurpose, or can find from others discards. The first thing I found was the top. It is a high pressure laminated countertop that a cabinet maker in my building no longer wanted. &lt;br /&gt;
The leg stock is Douglas fir 4×4’s that I have had for many years. The oak board is door sill stock that I got from an estate cleanout several years ago. It will now be used for a shelf. In this case I did buy a Douglas fir 2x10x8 board because I needed apron stock and wanted to begin the project so I spent a few dollars on that. The final dimensions for the bench were driven by the already existing top which is 24 1/4 x 42 1/2.</description>

            <description>When you walk in the front door of Roy Underhill’s Woodwright’s School and look to your left in the window hanging above Roy’s stuffed chicken is a large frame saw. &lt;br /&gt;
Now the chicken is an interesting object and makes one wonder why someone would have a chicken stuffed, and furthermore why it is at a woodworking school.</description>

            <title>Special Etch Saws  by Kim Malmberg</title>
            <description>My largest hand tool fetish are saws. I have been using them since I was a child and I have always liked hand sawing, even when I got into power tools. So saws are always welcomed to my home, even when sound judgment tells me I shouldn&apos;t bother.&lt;br /&gt;
I might end up with some hopeless cases, some entirely useless ones, but sometimes even if the saw is beyond salvation, it might still provide something very useful. It might be parts, it might help my research regarding certain saw makers or it might reveal something unexpected.</description>

            <title>Erik Anton Berg – Maker of Pliers by Kim Malmberg</title>
            <description>In another story on this website I mentioned that the Erik Anton Berg company made a lot more than just chisels and plane irons. Berg was also a prominent maker of pliers, amongst other things.&lt;br /&gt;
I have an unhealthy affection for those odd tools. I like files, knives, measure tapes, and I like pliers. They are a necessity when I restore old tools, but they are also beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;
So there’s no surprise then that I have found myself collecting pliers. I’m not fussy. I like American ones, English and German ones, but most of all I am always on the lookout for Berg pliers.</description>

            <title>The Ironmonger - The King of Hardware Trade Journals By Geoffrey Tweedale</title>
            <description>Anyone who has picked up an old saw, plane, or knife soon looks for a trade mark or maker’s name. These can identify and sometimes date an artefact. But one often wants to know more about the history of the manufacturer or individual. Reference books and other published sources – such as newspapers and directories – can sometimes provide a lead. But they do not usually give much detail. Ideally, business records – letters, accounts ledgers, and old pattern books – should help. But not many tool and cutlery enterprises have left an archive trail. So where does one look?&lt;br /&gt;
In the late 1970s, I pondered this question, when I was researching the 19th century Sheffield cutlery and tool trades. I tried trawling through consecutive years of one Sheffield newspaper, but soon gave this up as too laborious. Trade journals seemed to offer a more focused source, so I began looking at leading Victorian periodicals, such as The Engineer and Engineering. These were useful and the volumes were often indexed.</description>

            <title>Unusual Panel Saw - American Saw Co. by Wiktor Kuc and Joe Steiner</title>
            <description>Some time ago Joe Steiner (former partner at Sauer &amp; Steiner Toolworks) sent me this email:

&quot;Hey Wiktor,
I don&apos;t know if this interests you but here are some pics of a saw from a co. that is the first example I have seen (maybe you have some examples) but which I would think are relatively scarce. The saw was in rough shape and the etching was nowhere to be seen behind some very thick rust. I saw the handle in a pile of saws and it screamed special. Cleaned it a bit but didn&apos;t want to go too far.&lt;br /&gt;
It will never be a collector or even a user saw because of the unfortunate breakage on the nose but what a cool etch. I wonder if this was advertising in a useful form for their patented removable teeth in the circular blades that they may be more famous for. I don&apos;t know if you want to include it in the stuff you have on the American Saw co site.&quot;</description>

            <title>Eleven Grooved Box Step by Step - Part 1 and Part 2 by Jim Harvey</title>
            <description>I’ve made about a dozen of these now and will document the next batch here with photos. Most of the boxes I’ve made lately are in Cherry or Walnut and are pencil box size, 3″ x 8″. These next few will be larger, sized to hold 3″ x 5″ index cards.
&lt;br /&gt;
The lumber for this project is leftover tongue and groove wainscoat paneling from my fathers house circa 1974. These were milled 5″ wide and 11/16″ thick. He never finished the basement so after 35 years, some of the stock was available. The Cherry had darkened quite a bit and that had to be planed off to get an even color on both sides of the boards.</description>

            <title>The Eleven Grooved Box – Tools Set Up by Jim Harvey</title>
            <description>I am a big fan of Roy Underhill’s “The Woodwright’s Shop”. Last fall was the 32nd season, and he’s still wearing the same hat. 

The second episode was titled “The Eleven Grooved Box”, a project Roy uses in his woodworking school. You can see it here. 

I was attracted to this project because he uses Stanley 45 combination planes to make all eleven grooves. 

I have a Stanley 45 and have been looking for an appropriate project so I am trying to duplicate what Roy does as closely as I can.</description>

            <title>Dovetail Saws Put to the New Tools Test by Peter Sefton</title>
            <description>Needing to equip seven student toolboxes with dovetail saws, Peter Sefton and his latest crop of budding furniture makers test eight of the best saws from Britain and beyond, with surprising results.&lt;br /&gt;
When new students come and join me at the workshop, the initial few days concentrate on tool selection, sharpening, fettling and general care of both new and existing tools. We also discuss in detail buying new kit, which for most tools is quite straightforward but I always find the Dovetail saw the most tricky to advise upon.</description>

            <title>Setting up a Cap Iron by Bill Rittner</title>
            <description>When fettling a plane for the first time a lot of attention is usually paid to the iron, or blade, and rightfully so.&lt;br /&gt;
 It&apos;s because no matter what else you do to a plane if the iron is not sharp the plane won’t function at its best.&lt;br /&gt;
The next most important part in the process is the cap iron, commonly known as the chip breaker.</description>

            <title>Greyhound Panel Saw No. 8 - 20&quot;, 11ppi, crosscut by Daryl Weir</title>
            <description>Here&apos;s a good example of a late 1890&apos;s to 1900 &quot;Golden Era&quot; George Bishop No. 8, 20&quot; panel saw with a very fine 11ppi crosscut configuration. &lt;br /&gt;
With it&apos;s cover top &amp; let-in handle, this saw was meant to directly compete with Disston&apos;s D8 saw at that time. Unfortunately, Bishop&apos;s No. 8 saws show up far less often than the D8.&lt;br /&gt;
Saws of 24 inches and smaller panel sized saws seem to be a little harder to come by than their bigger full size 26&quot; counterparts.</description>

            <title>Quick half-blind dovetails... the hard part by Zach Dillinger</title>
            <description>If you want to make realistic reproductions, don&apos;t listen to the modern nonsense that every surface is a show surface. &lt;br /&gt;
Period furniture (i.e. when things were done by hand with speed) shows many tool marks. A large number of 18th century furniture pieces I have studied exhibit deep saw overcuts on the drawer fronts. &lt;br /&gt;
Some of these extend an inch beyond the baseline and are quite deep into the face of the drawer. They aren&apos;t simply to release the outside corner as some posit... they are far deeper than required for that task.</description>

            <title>Woodrough &amp; McParlin Handsaw No. 55 Bow Belly by Daryl Weir</title>
            <description>I took a chance bidding on this one on eBay as it had quite a few broken teeth, about 30 in all when it got to my door! &lt;br /&gt;
I was the only one that bid on it as most figured it was probably a lost cause with the number of teeth gone in the pictures. I figured it was a No.55 Bow Belly by the handle shape and the plated hardware.&lt;br /&gt;
I couldn&apos;t even see an etch when I got the saw as the blade was covered in a pretty heavy dark brown to black rust. Here are a few pictures from eBay that shows the condition.</description>

            <title>Wards Master Quality Miter Box by Jason Stamper</title>
            <description>I was poking around one of my favorite junk shops a few years ago , and to my delight stumbled upon on old miter box.&lt;br /&gt;
It was rusty and missing quite a few parts, but it had a nice saw with it and good bones. For some unknown reason I did not take a picture of it when I got it, but it was rough! &lt;br /&gt;
I cleaned all the rust off, repainted the main castings, and replaced as many parts as I could find.</description>

            <title>Atkins &quot;SILVER STEEL&quot; No. 53 massive rip saw with 28 &quot; long blade - 1900 era by Daryl Weir</title>
            <description>Geo. H. Bishop was proud to say about his saws that they should cut with... &quot;Speed &amp; Ease&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
Here is a good user grade saw, 1900 era Atkins &quot;SILVER STEEL&quot; No.53. It&apos;s a massive rip saw with the 28&quot; long blade.  Lets see how it cuts...&lt;br /&gt;
The edge has a very good crowning breast to it, just like the day it left the Atkins plant in Indianapolis. The edge did have some dings in it which I have worked out to the best of my ability. While I&apos;m not going to say it&apos;s pin straight, it&apos;s usable straight or I wouldn&apos;t be selling it.</description>

            <title>Channel Moldings by Zach Dillinger</title>
            <description>Channel moldings are commonly seen on seventeenth and early eighteenth century furniture.&lt;br /&gt;
They are very simple to do, yet add a nice shadow line that helps to break up an otherwise plain surface, which in this case is the four side rails for my poly chrome bevel molded dresser.&lt;br /&gt;
The channel molding is made up of a groove with molded features flanking either side of the groove. Ovolos, cavettos, ogees, and simple roundovers are seen.  These are usually done with a scratch stock and can be done after assembly if so desired.</description>

            <title>Bishop&apos;s Bulldog Toolbox Saw No. 200 and Disston&apos;s Advertising Blitz by Wiktor Kuc</title>
            <description>Sometime around 1915 Geo. H. Bishop company introduced a saw designed for a toolbox.&lt;br /&gt;
They named it a Bishop&apos;s Bulldog Toolbox Saw.&lt;br /&gt;
According to advertisements, the reason to this specialized type of saw was series of laws enacted to improve safety of surroundings when tools are in transport.</description>

            <description>I have read many books and seen tons of pictures of shops over the years. &lt;br /&gt;
Most of the shops in the books and online I see are nice big spaces crammed full of wood and tools.&lt;br /&gt;
So when I had the opportunity to set up a new shop at my house I naturally wanted to build a nice big shop.</description>

            <title>The New Flooring Saw by Geo. H. Bishop - from The National Builder, Vol. 50, February 1910, (Porter, Taylor &amp; Co., Chicago, 1910)</title>
            <description>In this age of fine hardwood floors and beautiful interior finish, the saw plays an important part. &lt;br /&gt;
The carpenter or workman needs a saw that will do the work accurately and quickly and without the aid of other tools to start the job with. The accompanying illustration shows the new floor saw that Geo. H. Bishop &amp; Co. are placing on the market. One glance at the illustration will tell our readers what this new saw should accomplish&lt;br /&gt;
 The reputation of the manufacturers is back of this saw guaranteeing that it will do everything it should, and live up - in quality and workmanship - to the Greyhound trademark placed upon every saw blade.</description>

            <title>How do you know when your tools are sharp? by Zach Dillinger</title>
            <description>The necessity of having a sharp chisel or plane iron with which to do your work is almost universally recognized (a very rare thing in the world of woodworking!). &lt;br /&gt;
Sure, you can muddle through a job with half-sharp tools, but sooner or later a dull-ish tool will negatively impact your work (or your finger!) as you try to force the tool to do work for which it is not prepared.</description>

            <title>Little Tillotson by Matt Cianci</title>
            <description>Some years ago in the early summer I found a guy on Craigslist getting rid of a bunch of old tools and decided to go check them out. I ended up getting a little cache of nice things, my favorite of which was a sweet gem of a saw that I noticed sticking out of the bottom of a box of rust. &lt;br /&gt;
All I could make out in the darkness of this guys basement was the finely shaped upper horn of a small back saw but that was enough for me. &lt;br /&gt;
I quickly fell in love with it and took it home despite its sorry condition. Here she was as found...</description>

            <title>One of the better curly apple handles I&apos;ve seen... - Simonds Handsaw No. 5 by Daryl Weir</title>
            <description>A few figured apple handles come along once in a while on vintage saws but for the most part are few and far between. This has got to be one of the better ones I&apos;ve seen and the pictures really don&apos;t do it justice.&lt;br /&gt;
It is installed on a late 1900 early 1910 era Simonds No.5, which is similar in looks to the Disston No.12, but not near as common. The original owner must have treasured it enough to scribe his name on the back side close to the handle.</description>

            <title>Plane Bevel Ups and Downs - with Paul Sellers</title>
            <description>A plane skims off many years of developed change and transforms roughness in touch to smoothness and the shapeless to shaped. It&apos;s hard to convey the impression a cutting edge brings to wood even though we live surrounded by its impact. &lt;br /&gt;
Millions of trillions of cuts undulate on the surfaces of wood around the world and we walk unconsciously by them. &lt;br /&gt;
I&apos;ve made millions of them myself using planes hundreds of years old and new.</description>

            <description>It was one of those late workshop evenings. The house was silent, I should have been fast asleep in my bed, but I was enjoying the moment and was rummaging around for a suitable cutter for an ongoing project. &lt;br /&gt;
I had been experimenting with adding thick vintage cutters to metal hand planes, and I was particularly looking for a 2 inch Erik Anton Berg cutter of good length. It turned out I had several so I started comparing them.</description>

            <description>The question has been asked by somebody, How old are trade-marks?&quot; who answers it by saying that they seem to be nearly as old as the industry of the race.&lt;br /&gt;
For instance: Ancient Babylon had property symbols, and the Chinese claim to have had trade-marks 1,000 years before Christ. Guttenberg, the very inventor of printing, had a lawsuit about a trade-mark, and he won it.</description>

            <description>The various surfacing planes are nearly alike, as regards the arrangement of the iron, the principal differences being in their magnitudes. &lt;br /&gt;
Thus the maximum width is determined by the average strength of the individual, and the difficulty of maintaining with accuracy the rectilinear edge. &lt;br /&gt;

As an ex-Army competitive shooter who is now a volunteer coach for a large junior program teaching Olympic small-bore, I’m constantly looking for ways to reduce the distractions and inefficiencies of match preparation, and getting the rifle off the ground to speed buttplate and sight adjustments is an excellent example.</description>

            <description>1874 was a very busy year at the Keystone Saw Works, the hub of Henry Disston and Sons mammoth saw and tool making enterprise. &lt;br /&gt;
Among many patents granted that year and utilized on new Disston saws was the ‘Improvement in handles for saws’ feature granted to William J. Reagan on December 8. The Reagan patent handle was found on the Disston No. 9 improved backsaw, which featured a decorative ogee shaped on the nose of the saw blade, as well as the standard Disston #4 backsaw with a square nose.</description>

Here&apos;s a little side note for the saw purchaser to look for: there is usually a 1 ppi graduation on 5 1/2 ppi and coarser rips saws and it is something one needs to always look for.</description>

            <title>The Care, Selection and Proper Fitting of Hand Saws by Charles Johnson, 1909</title>
            <description>During 1905 and 1904 the writer was Engineer for Porter Brothers of Spokane, on their contracts in connection with the construction of the Puget Sound Power Company&apos;s Plant at Electron, Washington.
One of the contracts called for the construction oi e box flume 8 feet square. The work of building 8-l/2 miles of this flume was sublet to the Northwest Bridge Company of Tacoma.&lt;br /&gt;
The bottom of the flume was double, being made of 2 inch plank lined with l inch stuff. The flume was built on true circular curves, the sides being sprung to place. The last board on each side of the bottom, both of the main floor and the lining had to be scribed to fit the sides and then ripped. After several unsuccessful attempts to do this work with power saws it was decided to do it by hand.</description>

            <title>Gauges and Other Tools - Shop Talks with the Young Mechanics by W. H. Vandervoort, 1899</title>
            <description>There is nothing more confusing to the young mechanic than the use of the several systems of gauges used in designating the sizes of wire, machine screws, drills and plate thickness. Unfortunately, most of these dimensions differ from each other for corresponding numbers by comparatively small amounts, yet an amount sufficient to cause error if the one is mistaken for the other. &lt;br /&gt;
The following table gives for comparison values for only a few numbers under each of the several gauges in most common use.</description>

            <title>1870 era, 10&quot; Disston&apos;s Jackson Fine 15PPI Blued Back Saw - Historically Significant  by Daryl Weir</title>
            <description>This is a historically significant Jackson 10&quot; back saw made by Disston. It&apos;s from the mid to later part of the 1870 period. The dating is based on screws used to fasten the handle. These are small thread diameter, Disston centennial screws.&lt;br /&gt;
They were patented by Henry Disston and featured domed head and a capped nut that covered the end of the male-end of the screw.</description>

            <title>Decoding Smith’s ‘Key’ by Matthew Cianci</title>
            <description>Joseph Smith was an English engraver working around the turn of the 18th century, and he is noted as having produced one of the Western world’s first tool catalogs, called formally, ‘Explanation or key, to the various manufactories of Sheffield, with engravings of each article’. &lt;br /&gt;
He was not a tool maker, or dealer, as far as we can tell (Kebabian, 1975), and he was not a cabinet maker, joiner, or even a woodworker. Quite ironic then, that his work stands as perhaps the one of the most important historical records of the tools of period woodworkers.</description>

However this time, try as I might, I could not get one of the breadboard ends on tight.</description>

            <title>Hand Saw Re-work by Will Myers</title>
            <description>My favorite hand saws are the older ones, particularly the ones made later in the 19th and early 20th centuries.&lt;br /&gt;
In my opinion this was the golden age of the handsaw. The blades were taper ground of good quality steel, the totes were shapely, looked nice, and were actually made to fit a human hand. There are still plenty of these saws around but are getting more expensive and a bit more scarce. &lt;br /&gt;
The saws made after these in the later 1900’s turn up quite often and are usually cheap. Most of these have good quality blades but the totes look and fit you hand terrible. I usually pass these saws up because totes will almost give you a blister just looking at them.</description>

            <title>Hand Drill No. 2A Transitional by Wiktor Kuc</title>
            <description>The hand drill No. 2A was introduced by Millers Falls Company around 1957.(1)  My collection of catalogs does not go beyond 1949, consequently the description of this drill is based on data from the catalog released by Millers Falls Tool Co., an entity organized in 1982.  &lt;br /&gt;
The Ingersoll-Rand Company, the owner of Millers Falls Company prior to 1982, sold all hand tool business to this new entity.  The description and image below is from the catalog published by this new organization - a Millers Falls Tool Co.&lt;br /&gt;
Major differences between this 1857 model and preceding 1938 edition are in the type of metal used for the frame, casting method of the frame, the size and appearance of the frame, and the spindle diameter.

The No. 2 drill released in 1938 and produced until 1857, (the introduction year of No. 2A) is made of malleable, sand-cast iron later machined to affect a few areas of the frame.</description>

            <title>Stainless Cutlery and the History of Portland Works in Sheffield by Geoffrey Tweedale</title>
            <description>In 2013, Sheffield celebrated an important centenary – the discovery of stainless steel for cutlery. The anniversary was duly marked by various events, exhibitions, and publications. It was an opportunity to reflect on the individuals and companies involved in this revolutionary breakthrough.&lt;br /&gt;
The steel and cutlery firms that shaped the introduction of stainless steel a hundred years ago have long since disappeared. Indeed - although one hardly dare whisper it - Sheffield no longer manufactures forged table-knife blades (though a handful of firms, it is true, continue to market cutlery). However, factory buildings last longer than people.</description>

These dates are significant. The year 1740 marks the beginning of the commercial production of crucible steel and 2013 marks the centenary of the discovery of stainless steel for the production of cutlery (and tools).</description>

            <title>Filing a Lamb’s Tongue... by Matthew Cianci</title>
            <description>So I recently acquired a nice old Disston #7 in need of a handle from one of my Woodnet connections (Thanks Dave!) &lt;br /&gt;
Judging from the medallion and etch, which is clearly visible, I’d say it dates from just before the turn of the century.&lt;br /&gt;
Prior to my taking possession, it seems that the previous owner out of spite, or perhaps a sick sense of humor, installed a tote on this poor old saw that more resembled an oven mit than a device to comfortably operate and control the saw blade. Thankfully though the devious bastard did at least retain the original nuts and said medallion in the installation.</description>

They are plentiful, low cost and can be made into a magnificent tool with a little time and effort.

            <description>Ordinary people do a lot of last minute shopping.  Some Galoots do a lot of last minute shoptime.  &lt;br /&gt;
One of them is me. &lt;br /&gt;
I rummaged through some boxes of off-cuts out in the shed this morning. It was a bit of a chore just getting to the shed, as the ice storm we had last night froze the gate shut, and I had to clamber over the fence to get into the back yard, and then hammer the ice off the shed door to get in.</description>

Approximately 300,000 were manufactured at the Royal Armories of St. Etienne, Maubeuge, and Charleville between 1806 and 1814. It was kept in service well into the 1840s when many were converted to percussion.</description>

            <description>Last winter I took a day off of work and hung out with Peter Follansbee at his shop at Plimoth Plantation.&lt;br /&gt;
Peter and I had become friendly through the Lie-Nielsen Hand Tool Events around New England, and I had sharpened a couple of saws for him. In the course of talking tools and shop, Peter showed me his saws. One of them was a nice 14 inch backsaw that he used occasionally for bench work like cutting tenon shoulders. I asked him how he liked it, and he said that he had some difficulty using it and that it was a bit uncomfortable.</description>

            <title>The Sharp Priorities… by Matthew Cianci</title>
            <description>When it comes to teaching saw sharpening, I generally recommend students follow a hierarchy while developing their skills.&lt;br /&gt;
By suggesting where to focus their attention first, it helps new filers get their saws sharp and cutting true with the shortest learning curve.&lt;br /&gt;
First, make sure all of the teeth are the same height. Jointing the saw before sharpening creates a visual “flat” on each tooth that guides this process. File until the flat is gone, but not a micro-spec further.</description>

            <description>The two doors are the next thing to make. These doors are made from 7/8 in stock that was clear and as straight grained as possible.&lt;br /&gt;
I cut the stiles a bit longer than needed so as to leave a little extra on the ends to help keep from spitting them when chopping the end mortises.&lt;br /&gt;
I clamped the four door stiles together and laid out the length of the doors and the rail locations first. Next, I laid out the length of the mortises for each of the three rails; by clamping all four stiles together for the layout assures both doors are identical to one another and the mortises line up perfectly.</description>

            <description>My wanting to make this replica began several years ago. The first saw I’d ever touched occurred 55 years past in my mom and dad’s shop—and that was a skewback D-20, crosscut saw.&lt;br /&gt;
Even as little as I was, I was drawn to the shape of it’s tote (no, I didn’t know the term for the handle was “tote” then); but I watched as Dad used it, I clearly recall how Dad’s “ballet” of using it mesmerized me.</description>

            <title>Sharpening Chisels and Some Comments by P. Michael Henderson</title>
            <description>I teach hand cut dovetails and the students use my chisels to chop out the waste. So after each class, I have to go through my chisels and sharpen the ones the students used.&lt;br /&gt;
Over the years, I&apos;ve tried different techniques for sharpening and have settled on a technique which I find to be fast and produces an excellent edge.&lt;br /&gt;
I use certain equipment in the sharpening process, and while some of it is expensive, it&apos;s generally a once in a lifetime purchase.</description>

            <title>Plimoth Saws by Matthew Cianci</title>
            <description>Last month I was at Plimoth Plantation teaching saw sharpening to the carpenters in the museum, along with Peter Follansbee (joiner in residence) and Mark Achison (presiding blacksmith). It was a blast. &lt;br /&gt;
One of several highlights of the day was when Mark pulled out some old saws that had been in the museum’s collection for a while. He knew nothing about them.</description>

            <title>Screwdriver Revival by James D. Thompson</title>
            <description>Hold the handle in your vise and heat the ferrule to red hot. There will be a lot of smoke and flames. &lt;br /&gt;
As soon as the wood inside the ferrule has cooked enough, you can pull the blade out with your fingers.&lt;br /&gt;
You don&apos;t have to heat the shaft, and if you like you can wrap it with a wet cloth during the ferrule heating.</description>

            <title>Louis Cubes by P. Michael Henderson</title>
            <description>Louis cubes are a striking veneer pattern but one that&apos;s somewhat difficult to accomplish. It requires great accuracy in cutting the pieces so jigs and/or spacers are needed to help cut the elements to the right size.&lt;br /&gt;
Louis cubes are named for Louis XIV of France because the cubes were popular on furniture during his reign. But the cubes go back much further in antiquity.</description>

            <description>&quot;For the last couple years I’ve been collecting data, photos and crazy ideas about pieces both antique and new that I call “The Furniture of Necessity.” And the six-board chest has been a particular source of fascination for me.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>Here is a demonstration of an early 1900&apos;s North Brothers &quot;Yankee&quot; No. 1545 hand drill. &lt;br /&gt;
This thing is an awesome hand drill with two speeds, forward and reverse ratchet, double ratchet, and a spindle lock. This is an amazing bit of early 20th century ingenuity.</description>

            <description>I have a book problem. I have books stored all over the house; in drawers, boxes, closets and other places.&lt;br /&gt;
The trouble comes when I need a particular book I end up having to hunt thru my various book stashes around the house to find the one I am looking for. &lt;br /&gt;
My book hunting routine is starting to get old. My lovely wife who is a very organized person is also getting tired of my little book problem too. I have been thinking about bookcase building for a while, but had not decided on what to build.</description>

            <description>As a member of the Sons of the American Revolution, I regularly do living history presentations to schools and youth groups.  &lt;br /&gt;
As my ancestors during that war were Pennsylvania riflemen and gunmakers (Newhard, Kuntz and Moll), one of my classes is on the evolution of the long rifle from the original German Jaeger.</description>

            <description>Next I worked on preparing for the glue up. Since there are three doors that make up this glue-up, I need to construct something that will hold the doors in place during the press. &lt;br /&gt;
I start by cutting a piece of plywood larger than the three doors. Since this will go into a vacuum bag, I like to smooth any sharp edges.</description>

            <title>Disassemble a Yankee Pushdrill by James D. Thompson</title>
            <description>I recently acquired a Yankee push drill which didn&apos;t want to function properly. I think it is a #41, but someone thought it proper to take the tool to a grinder and grind off the surface of the marked part of the barrel. I am going to presume that this was done to obliterate some owner&apos;s mark. I buffed up the damage a little so it wouldn&apos;t be quite so ugly.&lt;br /&gt;
I wanted to disassemble this beast to give it a good cleaning and oiling, but I could find no information on the internet that was useful. So I did what any good Galoot would do, I went at it in blissful ignorance. But I did take pictures, and I&apos;ll tell you how to do it. Here is a picture of the tool disassembled.</description>

            <title>A Moxon for Everyone by Scott Grandstaff</title>
            <description>I just finished a new vise. But really this vise is 40 years old. Or rather, parts of it are 40 years old. &lt;br /&gt;
Back when rocks were squishy, I was young and poor (still poor just not young anymore) I realized I needed a vise in the worst way. I was just starting out. I had nothing. Vises weren&apos;t exactly falling from the rooftops. &lt;br /&gt;
I grabbed some big all-thread and a scrap of 2X8. I put together something in a couple of days, which is fast considering I was coming from nowhere. It was my main and only vise and I didn&apos;t know any better.</description>

            <title>A Real Fish Story by Kim Malmberg</title>
            <description>Most woodworkers will recognize the tool maker Erik Anton Berg of Eskilstuna, Sweden. The Berg brand is well know across the globe.&lt;br /&gt;
Most people would also be able to recognize the Berg tools simply by their logo, an outlined shark.&lt;br /&gt;
Or, was it a fish? Actually, it was both.&lt;br /&gt;
No, it wasn&apos;t a genetic manipulation. It wasn&apos;t both at the same time. But when Erik Anton Berg started the company he chose a fish as the company logo, more specifically a Wels catfish, also known as sheatfish. The latin name is Sirulus Glanis.</description>

            <description>As I began getting into more traditional woodworking, and reading a lot of stuff about what tools to get, I decided that I needed a plow plane. &lt;br /&gt;
So, I went into research mode and tried to find out what I should buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

 A lot of the books I was reading talked about the fancy screw arm wooden planes, which were often said to be the most decorated and coveted tools in a workman’s tool chest.</description>

            <description>I think our tools have secrets to tell us if we are keen enough to listen to them. This is one of the reasons why I almost always prefer antique tools over new ones.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Re-casting Rings on a John Fray (Spofford) Brace by Will Myers</title>
            <description>The Spofford style brace is by far my favorite bit brace. &lt;br /&gt;
They are so simple yet so perfect. You can change bits with a quick twist of the wing nut, Spofford’s are also lighter weight than most braces. &lt;br /&gt;
The Spofford chuck was patented in 1859. John S. Fray &amp; Company started making these braces the same year, Stanley bought out Fray in 1920 and continued to produce them into the 1940’s.&lt;br /&gt;
Being as simple as they are there is no too much to go wrong with them. One problem I have noticed on a lot of them is the pewter rings that hold the handle halves together are either loose or broken. I think the rings are a nice detail on these braces and decided to figure out a way to fix them. I had a couple of braces that needed the rings repaired; here is what I came up with.</description>

            <description>All the skews I have bought have been at least 1/4” thick. &lt;br /&gt;
I thought I was sharpening them correctly, but obviously, I was not. I recently came across a thin skew, and it changed my life. &lt;br /&gt;
I decided to make one. I used a piece of High Speed Steel power hacksaw blade, It is about 1” wide and 3/32&apos; thick. I cut piece about 6” long and ground off the teeth.</description>

            <description>Mr. Webster’s definition of a box is: a rigid typically rectangular container with or without a cover.&lt;br /&gt;
Small boxes are always an enjoyable project. They do not require much material and if you keep it fairly simple they do not take long to make. Finding a use for them is never a problem either. &lt;br /&gt;
If you like to cut dovetails they are excellent practice projects; if you make a bad mistake all you need is another scrap of wood to make a replacement piece.</description>

            <title>Pexto Samson Brace Repair by Adam Maxwell</title>
            <description>Pexto Samson Braces&lt;br /&gt;
I&apos;m torn on whether to advertise how great the Pexto Samson braces are, because they can still fly under the radar on eBay, unlike the more-popular Yankee braces. However, the Pexto braces are one of the nicest-looking heavy-duty braces made, in my opinion, and the Samson chuck is superb.&lt;br /&gt;
The Samson chuck was Pexto&apos;s top-of-the-line chuck, with a ball-bearing head and the ability to hold round or tanged bits. Pexto claimed that it “Has tighest grip and easiest release of any Brace Chuck made.” in their 1923 catalog. In my experience, they work as advertised, and you actually have to be careful not to overtighten.&lt;br /&gt;
Braces with the Samson chuck include the 8000 and 8200 series, which are identical except for the enclosed ratched on the less-common 8200. Both feature ball bearing head and brass-bushed center handle, and were nickel-plated. Cocobolo and “tropical hardwood” were used in earlier and later models, respectively, and A, B, C, D, or E was appended to the model number as changes were made.</description>

            <description>The debate over what the heck a table saw should be used for has raged for a while now.&lt;br /&gt;
I made one a while ago (here and here) and have been using it around the house and in my shop since then, and whether or not I know what it was truly designed for, its proven to be very handy. &lt;br /&gt;
Yesterday I had an hour or so to build the carcase for a utility cabinet to go around the electrical panel in our basement.</description>

Sometimes things happen you really never expect; teaching a class at St. Roy’s Cathedral was not something I ever thought I would be doing.&lt;br /&gt;
With so many great woodworkers in the world and Roy picks me… go figure?
I am not going to go into great detail on the construction process. The building techniques and materials we used were basically the same as what I wrote about here last year.</description>

            <description>I made several marquetry trays over the past year or so and now need to have a box to store them in. This page documents the project of building the box.&lt;br /&gt;
7/1/2013 When I made the party stands (pictures below) I knew that I wanted to build a case for storing them. I didn&apos;t know exactly what I&apos;d do but I had some ideas. Now that I finished the stands, it&apos;s time to start on the storage box.&lt;br /&gt;
My original idea was to build a box that would also function as an end table on the side of a sofa. The box would have a door, and inside would be &quot;slots&quot; which the folded-up stands would slide into.</description>

            <title>Brass Ratchet and How to Polish Metal by Scott Grandstaff</title>
            <description>I had been looking for a brass ratchet for a while. How is it possible not to love a brass ratchet? It is not possible for me I can tell you that.&lt;br /&gt;
One day not too long ago, our own Redvise (Brian) sent me a note and said the one he had lost for a long time turned up and did I still want it? Of course I was overjoyed!</description>

            <title>Small Parallel-jawed Wrench, Work magazine, March 23, 1889</title>
            <description>About two years ago I saw this wrench on eBay. 

The description was rather enigmatic, but the look of it was eye-catching: &quot;Collectible, unusual old vintage double-sided adjustable wrench. Antique, rare tool.&quot; It sold for $45.00. I didn’t bid on it, but saved a few pictures.</description>

            <title>How I file a Saw by Matthew Cianci</title>
            <description>A recent customer asked if I would document the process of taking his old Disston D-8 (below) and share pics with him. I agreed and thought it would also make a great post. I’ll try to let the pics do the talking.&lt;br /&gt;
Before I can file and sharpen I needed to smith the saw to remove a bit of a kink and bow. To do this I keep pressure on the plate by bending it down on the anvil and use a specially modified hammer.</description>

            <description>The BAG&apos;s (Bay Area Galoots) are a loosely formed group of Galoots having a love of old tools and techniques, and fine camaraderie in common. No strict leader, no strict meetings, no rules. &lt;br /&gt;
They stay together year after year, with impromptu meetings for fun times, early dawn raids of the swap meets, and occasional great finds of old tool hordes, shared among many.</description>

            <title>Liogier Handle-Makers Rasp by Matthew Cianci</title>
            <description>As soon as I discovered the Liogier Handle-Makers Rasp I ordered it. No thinking. No hemming and hawing. I just found the site, and bought it. That&apos;s how excited I was to even learn of its existence. Since I received the tool, it has not surprisingly become one of the few I can&apos;t live without.</description>

            <title>So you want to learn how to use a sash fillister? by Zach Dillinger</title>
            <description>This question came up recently on one of the woodworking forums I frequent.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I took a few photos demonstrating why you need a sash fillister for sash work. It doesn&apos;t see much work outside of that specialty, but it can come in handy for moldings.﻿</description>

            <title>Mitered Breadboard Ends by Adam Maxwell</title>
            <description>Last fall, it seemed that our oldest (9 at the time) would benefit from a desk of his own, so I started looking at images of vintage school desks using Google’s image search. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The style that seemed best-suited is a simple desk with an sloping top that lifts up to reveal storage.  Since I had poplar on hand, I built the desk from that. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The front legs were turned on a pole lathe, and the drawbored mortise-and-tenon joinery was all done by hand.  The intent from the outset was to paint the base, but I wanted a natural wood top, and poplar is too soft for a good writing surface.</description>

            <title>Restoring a 14” Disston backsaw by Ethan Sincox</title>
            <description>When I bought a Craftsman miter box off of Craig’s List, one of the reasons I wanted it was because of the backsaw that came with it.

Experience has shown me I like the fit and feel of Disston backsaw totes from the turn of the (last) century. As soon as I got it home, I cleaned up the medallion and the saw back a bit (just enough to read them). 

After a little research and measuring, I concluded I had picked up a 12 TPI 14” Disston backsaw with an applewood tote and an 1896-1917 medallion.</description>

            <title>Joseph Smith’s Carcase Saw by Matthew Cianci</title>
            <description>In his own words, Matt Cianci admits that he is a fanatical lover of saws...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The last two weeks have been a bit of a blur (I was sick), but somewhere in the mix I managed to finally finish my carcase saw based on Joseph Smith’s ‘Key to the Manufactories of Sheffield’, a work I have obsessed over for years thanks to its images of early 19th century handsaws.

The moment the wax was dry on the tote, I started grabbing anything and everything in my shop to try out the cut….scrap wood, electrical cords, small animals, even a vagrant that likes to hang out in my neighborhood and wanders into my shop occasionally….they all went under the teeth of my new saw to test its metal. And what fun I had!!!</description>

            <description>I am asking for help to identify this breast drill. There is no information on maker, date or place of making. &lt;br /&gt;
The drill doesn&apos;t have any ID marks.  It is made of bronze (?) or brass with exception of main rod that constitutes a frame.  The crank plate is also mage of forger iron.&lt;br /&gt;
 Please send me your ideas and comments to info@wkFineTools.com.</description>

            <title>Zach Dillinger showing his home-made plow plane...</title>
            <description>A while back I got an early plow plane. It exhibits some characteristics of 18th century English plows, but it was unusable.&lt;br /&gt;
I wanted to be able to use that style of plow.  So I made one to fit my full set of Ohio Tool plow irons.</description>

            <title>Spier &amp; Co., No. 12 - large 28&quot;, 4 1/2ppi rip saw by Daryl Weir</title>
            <description>Here&apos;s a nice split nut, straight back, No.12 Spier &amp; Co. large 28&quot; 4 1/2ppi rip saw hailing from the Victorian era of the late 1860&apos;s to early 1870&apos;s. 

This second line of saw was made by firm of Wheeler, Madden &amp; Clemson of the Monhagen Saw Works, in Middletown, New York.  

The company later became a part of the National Saw Company in about 1890.  By 1893 the National Saw Co. included Harvey Peace, Woodrough &amp; McParlin, and Richardson Bros., all of which had been later absorbed by the behemoth H. Disston &amp; Sons.</description>

            <title>Rehabilitating Craftsman Miter Box by Ethan Sincox</title>
            <description>Recently, I stumbled across a Craig’s List ad for an old Craftsman miter box. I opened the link and checked it out. &lt;br /&gt;
It was just what I was looking for – a simpler model, similar to the Stanley 150, with the overarm saw guides, but without the length gauge. It was a deal at $18.&lt;br /&gt;
The fact that it came with a 14” Disston back saw, with what looked to be a solid, chip-free applewood tote in the late 1800/early 1900 style that I like so much, made it a doubly good deal! I’ll write up something on restoring the backsaw a bit later; for now, let’s focus on that miter box.</description>
