            <title>Dovetail Joints - Manufacturer and Builder, 1865 </title>
            <description>The strongest and most permanent joint made in carpentry and cabinet-making, where pieces of wood are fastened together at right angles, is the dovetail.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When made in some of its most approved and perfected forms, it is equal in neatness and artistic finish to the miter joint. The miter is a comparatively neater method of joining wood at an angle, but the dovetail possesses the greatest possible strength.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It is generally employed in articles made of thin materials, such, for instance, as drawers, boxes, chests, etc. If we examine a dovetailed box, we observe that it consists of six pieces, or sides, four of which arc interlaced, or dovetailed together at the corners, forming a rigid frame-work. This is shown in Fig. 1. </description>

            <title>Brace Yourselves! - Building a Reproduction of 19th Century English Brace</title>
            <description>I finally can do something with that walnut! For ages now I have had a nice lump of English walnut sitting in the workshop.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
t was a gift from my mate Douglas and I&apos;ve wanted to do something special with it. So today I finally got off my backside and out into the summer sunshine with my best mate ALFIE...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I have a number of 19th century examples, all with something needing doing to them!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
One has lost its bit release button... one has a repaired crack... and the worst but prettiest.. has been in and out if ICU over many decades and in a sorry state indeed! So, I thought I&apos;d make a KT Tools one.</description>

            <title>Getting the Most from the Millers Falls MF 1 “Cigar Shave”</title>
            <description>The Millers Falls &apos;cigar&apos; shave is probably one of my favorite tools but it used to drive me bonkers!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Sharpened and set right, it&apos;s one of the most versatile tools ever and can do things absolutely no other can. It shaves very tight radius internal curves...yet runs true on the flat... turning to external curves with ease.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But, and it&apos;s a huge BUT, most are left on the shelf unused because they are either not razor sharp or the user can&apos;t get the setting right or both.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In this article I will show how to sharpen the strange cutter, then when that variable is removed, how to set it to cut efficiently and with ease.</description>

            <title>A Woodworker’s Rose (brace) by Jason Stamper</title>
            <description>Several years ago I bought a lot of 5 bit braces on eBay. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I think I paid around $30 for 5 of them, and it seems the rust scared off the other bidders.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In any event, I was thrilled with what I ended up with. I got a cheap Stanley (which I have long since traded off), an early all iron Fray, a small odd blacksmith made one, a rare Holt brace, and possibly my favorite a rare Rose (Millers Falls) brace.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Most of these braces needed serious cleaning, and several were missing parts. However, nothing was cracked or un-fixable, so I was thrilled. In this article I am going to focus on the Rose brace, but I will do a few follow up articles on the others.</description>

            <title>Skills of the Sheffield Hand Forger by Geoffrey Tweedale</title>
            <description>This sepia photograph of a Sheffield hand forger – apparently at the leading pocket-knife firm of George Wostenholm &amp; Son – is undated. But it is certainly pre-1914 and may be even earlier (perhaps from the 1890s). The photo is mounted on a small card and measures only about 10cm square. Nevertheless, one can see clearly into the forger’s workshop with its open hearth, array of tongs, forging block, and anvil. The forger himself holds a hammer with a wooden handle that has been worn to shape by years of use. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The posed stance, with the forger seeming to gaze wistfully through the unglazed window, only tells part of the story. Forgers at work never stood still or sat down. They were too busy working the bellows, moving blades in and out of the fire, and repeatedly hammering and manipulating them. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Hand forging was strenuous – indeed, it was one of the most arduous jobs in the Sheffield trades – though many forgers seem to have thrived on the work.</description>

            <title>Atkins Passes Half Century Mark - Barrel and Box, 1915</title>
            <description>It is certainly an enviable record when an institution can boast of having been established over half a century.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
September 17 was an epoch-making period in the history of E. C. Atkins &amp; Co., of Indianapolis, Ind., maker of the celebrated silver steel saws, as that date marked the fifty-eight anniversary of the founding of that institution, one of the oldest and largest industries in Indiana.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A story of the growth of the company will doubtless prove interesting to the readers of the Barrel and Box.</description>

            <title>W. M. &amp; C. - The Standard No. 999 by Daryl Weir</title>
            <description>The Standard, No. 999
is one of the nicer saws produced by the Monhagen Saw Works.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The 1895 catalog of National Saw Co. describes it as &quot;Extra Refined Spring Steel with Polished and Carved Apple Handle, Five Improved Screws.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&apos;ve handled many saws from most of the major American manufacturers over the years that I&apos;ve been refurbishing. This has given me an opportunity to evaluate their overall general quality and especially the quality of steel used for making the saw plates. I&apos;ve also sharpened over a thousand saws, which has further provided me with an insight into quality of the plate material and quality of workmanship employed in processing of this most important part of a saw.</description>

            <title>Special Plane by James E. Price</title>
            <description>Did you ever use a plane that felt like you were wearing it like a glove?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This old plane is so unusual that I simply must share it with you.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I have owned this plane for four years but I first saw it forty-eight years ago right after a friend of mine, Bruce Debo of Devils Elbow Missouri, bought it in an area of central Missouri that was homeland to early German settlers. Bruce was an Ozark coffin maker and every time I visited his shop I admired this old plane.</description>

            <title>The Magic of Seaton&apos;s Chest by Jim Hendricks</title>
            <description>I tried so hard to sleep last night... knowing today would be a special day... but try as I might... excitement prevailed, and I dozed lightly, pondering the moment.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Soon I would be honored to be close to a treasure very few are privileged to experience. Not only viewing the tool world&apos;s greatest treasure, but touching and examining each and every tool... to live history.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The chest is normally kept behind glass in its own room in Rochester&apos;s Guildhall Museum, a short 20 minute drive from my house in northwest Kent, some 30 miles southeast of London.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

            <title>Sparks No. 70 by Douglas Coates</title>
            <description>For a small island we have more than our share of the best plane-makers here in the UK.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Karl Holtey, Bill Carter, Phil Edwards and others have set a World-class standard but it is exciting to see a new maker appearing. It’s also very pleasing to find that demand for premium hand-made tools is strong.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Oliver Sparks is still young in years but he radiates a passion for the craft that is backed by rigorous research and thorough knowledge. His planes exude that elusive ‘master’s touch’. He will go far quite quickly, no doubt about it.</description>

            <title>Classic English Mortise Chisel - The &quot;Pig Sticker&quot; by Jim Hendricks</title>
            <description>For years I have been attracted to tools that were uniquely British...the infills...the wooden moulding planes and perhaps the most unique...the &quot;delicately&quot; named &quot;pig sticker&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This type of mortise chisel shouts &quot;mean and nasty&quot; and its bark truly is as sharp as its bite!!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Recently... the English mortise chisel, to give it its correct name, has been the focus of new interest... due in no small part to the folks at Tools For Working Wood and the great toolmaker Ray Iles... so I have placed a link at the bottom for anyone interested in further reading.</description>

            <title>Making Files by Hand at Kearney &amp; Foot - American Machinist, 1880</title>
            <description>The process of making files by hand-cutting, though carried on from the time files were first used, is imperfectly understood by the great body of mechanics, in its present improved state.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We have recently given some special attention to the subject, and will endeavor to describe the process as carried on in what we believe to be the largest factory producing exclusively hand-cut files in this country.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When purchased, the steel is taken to the store room, which contains twenty-five tons and upwards. From the store room it is taken to the forging shop, where it is cut to the required lengths for forging. Each length is then piled away by itself.</description>

            <title>Hand Plane Basics - part 3 - Sharpening by Bill Rittner</title>
            <description>Well, to date we have found an inexpensive vintage plane. We disassembled it, learned what the parts are, cleaned and de-rusted it, and made any necessary repairs. The next step to putting this plane back to work is to sharpen the iron/blade and fit the capiron.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
No matter how pretty your tool looks if it’s cutting edge is not sharp it will never work properly. Sharpening is the key to making any cutting tool work as it was designed to. Whenever you encounter a problem cutting with a tool the first thing you should do is to sharpen it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you have been around hand woodworking tools for any time you know that there are as many methods of sharpening as there are hand tool woodworkers. The key to an enjoyable hand tool experience is picking a sharpening method that best suits your budget and needs and sticking with it until you become proficient. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The time wasted trying all the latest, greatest methods and equipment is better spent mastering the method you started with. Leave the atomic powered laser sharpener on the tool suppliers shelf, at least until you have mastered the system you began with. Then, and only then will you have the knowledge and experience to know what to look for in order to make your sharpening system even more efficient.</description>

            <title>Selecting and Using Files by James F. Hobart, 1885</title>
            <description>How many machinists know a good file when they see it?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I don&apos;t believe one in fifty can take a pile of files and pick out the best one. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The average man will pick up two or three, turn them over, squint along the corners, pick out the straightest one and call it as &quot;good as any.&quot; They don&apos;t seem to have any idea that a file may be soft, or fire-cracked, or burned. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If they were choosing a cold chisel, they would look out for all these things, but &quot;a file is a file&quot; so long as it has teeth and tang.</description>

            <title>Saving the Stewart by Jim Hendricks</title>
            <description>I just received this in the post, eBAY as usual, and cheap as chips.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The seller even emailed me afterwards to check that I had seen the chip out of the horn!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Well... that&apos;s the least of the problems sir!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As you can see the handle is completely broken in a number of places and &quot;repaired&quot; in one. That last &quot;repair&quot; is the most difficult part of the restoration.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I am keeping as much original as possible and over the next few weeks I shall be posting some of the tips and wrinkles I&apos;ve picked up over the years so that others may feel confident to restore a treasure back to working condition.</description>

            <title>Stanley No. 45 Case I Made in 1975 by James E. Price</title>
            <description>This plane has special memories for me and it is one of the first planes I cased right after I learned how to cut dovetails by hand.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I didn&apos;t have much choice of seasoned wood back then so an old farmer gave me some willow oak boards that he had in the loft of his barn and fashioned this box from them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The box was made to hold the 45 with the long rods in it and to store the cased cutters at one end.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The plane is held firmly in place with a bridle and rod ends are inserted in holes in a bracket on the back wall of the box. This has been very effective in keeping the plane fully restrained inside the case.</description>

            <title>Marvels of Modern Tool Making - Saws by Bernard L. Johnson, 1912</title>
            <description>“I understand, Mr. Editor, you are now something of a saw maker,” the Boss Carpenter observed as he slid into the visitor’s chair and helped himself to a pipe full of our tobacco.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
“Well no, we&apos;d hardly want to claim that,&quot; we rejoined, “To become a saw maker - a modern saw maker you understand - has taken some 5,000 years. We do know a good saw though, when we get hold of one; and you better believe we have a greater admiration and respect for these faithful tools now, after seeing exactly how they are made, than we ever had before.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
“You know we have always been a crank on good tools, and especially saws. We have been uncommonly interested in these, probably because of their ancient and honorable origin. In a few minutes you will hear something about some old and curious saws, and will see then the sentiment that clings around every high grade carpenters’ saw today for us literary fellows. You are so hard headed and practical probably a saw is just a saw to you, and so long as it does its work that&apos;s all you care.”</description>

This friend, born in the 1830’s, serves as real window into the past, and a reminder of simpler times. Even with its tremendous age it has never let me down, and I shall be quite surprised if it ever does.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Who is this friend you ask. Why it is a wooden brace of the type used to turn various boring bits. And although I do not use it every day, when I do it is a great joy to use.</description>

            <title>Disston D8 - full size 28&quot;, 5 ppi Rip Saw, 1880s - a review by Daryl Weir</title>
            <description>One of Disston’s main stays in production line was the ever popular D8 thumbhole or dual grip rip saw. The saw shown here is an early 1880&apos;s era, 28&quot; (blade length) with a 5ppi graduated to 6ppi at the point. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In recent years the term &quot;variable pitch&quot; has been used on saws that have &quot;graduated teeth&quot;. Historically, this term is actually not correct.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;Pitch&quot; was a term used in all of the old catalogs and saw literature that meant the same as the &quot;rake&quot; on the front of the teeth. Think of it as the same as the &quot;pitch&quot; on your roof. &quot;Pitch&quot; is used on screws or threads and to my knowledge was never used on saws back in the day.</description>

            <title>Anti-Racking Spacers - Workshop Appliances by Cecil Rogers</title>
            <description>Racking is as old as vises are! End vises, face vises, Moxon vises... Most seem to suffer from it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Over the last twenty years or so, there has been a hand tool renaissance, and there are thousands of resources for hand tool enthusiasts out there. Oddly, when one searches for ways to solve the racking problem, there seem to be far fewer ideas to deal with it.</description>

            <title>Stringing or Purfling Saw by James E. Price</title>
            <description>Over a period of at least 50 years I have made many of my own woodworking tools to fulfill special needs.&lt;br /&gt;
The best way to describe the tool in the photos is that it is a saw. I know, it does not look like a saw but it is a saw I use to insert wooden stringing or purfling into some of my projects.</description>

            <title>Three Little Castings by Jim Hendricks</title>
            <description>One day, flicking through eBay 
I stumbled on these three little orphans.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Having won the auction for a song…(after all…they WERE three old rusty hulks!)… I asked the seller if he knew anything of the history.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He replied that he did not know much other than his grandfather said he got them from his father with a view to completing them and alas... neither achieved their goal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
So that puts them into the Victorian era… a time when purchasing castings from the foundry was the cheaper option taken by many craftsmen who were quite capable of finishing them off. After all, planes of this quality were a week’s wage for many a cabinet maker of the era!</description>

            <title>Planing Board - Workshop Appliances by Cecil Rogers</title>
            <description>You don&apos;t need a planing board. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But, if you have one, you will use it... a LOT!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Using battens, doe&apos;s feet, holdfasts, planing stops, and other appliances, a proper woodworking bench will perform every single task that a planing board will. So, what&apos;s the advantage? What could it possibly have to offer if one can use other methods of work? Why build one of these &quot;space takers?&quot; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The short answer is speed and ease of setup, combined with rock solid support.</description>

            <title>The Forgotten Art of the Two-Legged Parser by Geoffrey Tweedale</title>
            <description>The multi-blade knife has a history that stretches back at least a couple of hundred years.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It was in the late 19th century that the multi-blade knife reached its peak in terms of workmanship, quality, and finish.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The leading centre for their manufacture was Sheffield.</description>

            <title>Building a Trestle Table - part 2 by Will Myers</title>
            <description>The next step in the trestle table build is the long stretchers. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The length of these are of course variable to whatever length of table you want to make. The stretchers for this table are 63in long overall by 1 1/4in thick and 3 1/2in tall yellow pine. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The have a 5in long by 2 1/2in tall tenon cut on either end to create a tusk tenon that will be joined to the legs. It is best to do the layout of the tenon shoulders with the stretchers clamped together to assure the shoulders locations are the same on both pieces. I used a mortise gauge set to 2 1/2in and centered on the width of the stretcher to lay out the width of the tenon then rip them out and sawed the shoulders.</description>

            <title>Building a Bench Hook by Cecil Rogers</title>
            <description>A bench hook is nothing more than three sticks of wood.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
More often than not, they can be made of scraps and cutoffs. Designs can be dirt simple or very involved. Even the simple designs can change depending on the goal of its use, but with a little planning, they can be turned into double or triple duty appliances. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Once built, many appliances will last a lifetime. Some will not. Bench hooks fit into the second group. Over time, they will get beat on, cut, pounded, and used up. It&apos;s just the nature of the beast. I built a few of the very involved versions early on. It adds time and complexity to something I&apos;ve discovered, at least for me, should be kept dirt simple.</description>

            <title>Matt’s Dutch Tool Chest by Matthew R. Lisk</title>
            <description>After several years of accumulating tools and having less than ideal ways to store them, I finally decided this would be the year for a proper tool chest.&lt;br /&gt;
My last &quot;tool chest&quot; was an old GI foot locker that I had picked up at a yard sale. It held all of my tools, but it was greatly lacking in both form and function. &lt;br /&gt;
I had read several articles and books on tool chests and was nearly set on building a traditional floor chest based on Chris Schwarz’s book, The Anarchist’s Tool Chest.&lt;br /&gt;
Ultimately I needed something that would be fairly quick to build, so I settled on the Dutch tool chest featured in the October 2013 issue of Popular Woodworking (I recommend picking up or downloading a copy if you plan on building this chest).&lt;br /&gt;
Not only was this chest surprisingly quick to build, it holds a ton of tools and put many different hand tool skills to the test.</description>

            <title>Scottish Panel Plane by Jim Hendricks</title>
            <description>Without any doubt my little Scottish infill panel plane is my most “go to” plane of all.&lt;br /&gt;
Another masterpiece from my favourite auction site, this plane came to me fairly cheaply but in need of quite a bit of work.&lt;br /&gt;
The first thing to tackle was the chip to the rear handle… as the sharp edge was very uncomfortable to hold...</description>

            <title>English Joiners&apos; Tallow Pots by James E. Price</title>
            <description>It was a chilly, rainy day on the Ozark Border all day so it was a good excuse to hide in the shop and make something useful...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Today&apos;s project is a tallow pot, a small wooden box in which beef or mutton tallow or sometimes beeswax were kept for lubricating the soles of planes and the blades of backsaws. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When coated with wax or tallow the sole of a plane glides over the wood with little resistance and a good backsaw won&apos;t bind or chatter in the kerf due to the lubricant.</description>

            <title>Portable Planing Board by Jim Harvey</title>
            <description>Lately I’ve gotten much more interested in using hand tools...&lt;br /&gt;
I don’t have a real bench though, just an old office desk and there is not a good way to hold a board down flat to work on it. Holdfasts just don’t work well with an office desk.&lt;br /&gt;
My 11×48 inch planing board clamps easily in the bench front vise, or in a Work Mate. I made a cam arrangement to secure the work. There are 3/4 inch holes every 2 inches down the rigid spine. It takes a pair of cams to cover the 2 inch range. In this photo the larger cam is lying on the bench at rear along with the home made spanner wrench used to torque the cams.</description>

            <title>J. Taylor &amp; Son - 26 inch Hand Saw by Daryl Weir</title>
            <description>The English saws are not my specialty, but this one caught my eye... I purchased it on a whim from eBay a while back.&lt;br /&gt;
Now, I knew this saw was in rough shape when I bought it. &lt;br /&gt;
However, it appeared to have an interesting handle – the wood had an open grain and I suspected it is either mahogany or rosewood. &lt;br /&gt;
The five iron screws appeared to be somewhat crudely made.</description>

            <description>As I was using my favorite D router today and listened to the cutter shaving the wood from a recess and marveled at how quiet it was compared to the scream of an electric router.&lt;br /&gt;
That is why I like to use unplugged tools. I can hear and feel how the blade is engaging the wood. I have owned this old router for years and each time I get it out to use I marvel at the patina on it from decades of use.</description>

            <title>Addis: A Famous Name in Carving Tools By Geoffrey Tweedale</title>
            <description>In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, only a few manufacturers established a reputation in the niche market of carving tools for woodwork. &lt;br /&gt;
These included Henry Taylor, Robert Marples, Robert and I. &amp; H. Sorby, and Ashley Iles. They were based in Sheffield. &lt;br /&gt;
However, the first enterprise to carve its name (as it were) into carving tools manufacture was Addis. It was once said that ‘the best, and indeed the only [carving tools] that are fit for use, are made by Mr. Addis’ (T. Martin, The Circle of the Mechanical Arts, 1813). Addis was based in London.</description>

            <title>Hand Plane Basics - part 2 by Bill Rittner</title>
            <description>Now that all the parts of the #5 plane have been thoroughly cleaned, de-rusted and inspected, as can be seen in the photo above, it is time for the next step. All parts of the plane are shown in the photo except the knob and tote. These wood parts are being stripped and refinished and will be installed later.&lt;br /&gt;
The next thing that needs to be done is to determine that the sole of the plane is flat. This plane still shows the pattern of the original factory grinding so no work needs to be done to the sole or the sides. You can check the flatness of your plane’s sole using a good quality, (such as Browne &amp; Sharp or Starrett), steel scale, commonly called a rule, and a feeler gage.</description>

            <description>As far as I can tell, this particular 45 dates from the late 50s. Almost new! It was a Christmas present to myself.&lt;br /&gt;
Actually, I already had a 45 but dropped it onto the concrete garage floor. In a fit of despair, I bid on this 45 on eBay and won.&lt;br /&gt;
Meanwhile I was able to repair the cracked main stock on the first 45 so now I have two of them working. Neither came with an original box which was likely cardboard anyway. Hence this project. Guess I will have to build two of them.</description>

            <description>First of all... huge thanks to Shane for the chance to have a look at this fine saw.&lt;br /&gt;
And fine it is… as in &quot;fine art&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
Before I begin my findings... I will emphasize that I am looking at this mostly from an aesthetic and ergonomic standpoint.&lt;br /&gt;
I will leave other to review &quot;making dovetails&quot;. I am sure there are some who are past masters at this! However, things repeated stay in the mind after all!&lt;br /&gt;
I&apos;ve spoken with Shane at length... he has a true passion for his craft and the attention to detail is astounding. This extends to the packaging, which when you buy a boutique saw, is sort of expected but often absent these days.</description>

            <title>Acme 120 No-Set, 26 inch Rip Saw, 1910 era by Daryl Weir</title>
            <description>&quot;Disston&quot; on Saws is a Guarantee of Quality!&lt;br /&gt;
No. 120 Acme, skewback blade, extra London spring steel, selected and polished, warranted. &lt;br /&gt;
Apple handle, carved and polished, five brass screws. &lt;br /&gt;
Specially Made to Work Without Set for Smooth Cutting in Dry Lumber.&lt;br /&gt;
This saw is from the 1910 era and still has a nice wide blade, one of its pluses. The keystone etch is pretty much gone, the secondary etch and tertiary &quot;Acme&quot; etch is partially there but honestly, all is pretty much impossible to read.</description>

            <title>Building a 19th Century-style Parlor Guitar, Part 2 – The Body  with Jason Stamper</title>
            <description>With the neck and headstock roughed out I moved on to making the body of the guitar. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The first thing I did was to plane the material down to the correct thickness on my thickness planer. Then I joined the top and back pieces up. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I did this by putting a ruler under the joint on a piece of plywood and then clamping the outside edges down while keeping the joint tight. Once the edge clamps were in place I pulled the ruler out and pressed the center seam down with a caul and more clamps.</description>

            <title>Building a Saw Till by Jeff Strickland</title>
            <description>I finally decided that hanging all my saws from two hooks on the wall wasn&apos;t good enough any more, so I started on a saw till.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Dimensions are 24&quot; wide, 40&quot; tall. Basic, open style with slanted sides. The bottom is 6&quot; deep and I will build either two drawers and a cubby, or three drawers.</description>

            <title>John Sorby &amp; Sons and Lockwood Brothers - Sheffield, UK</title>
            <description>John Sorby &amp; Sons became one of the most famous firms making sheep shears and woodworking augers for shipwrights in first part of 19th Century. The designs of these tools were patented.&lt;br /&gt;
In 1844, Lockwood Brothers acquired John Sorby &amp; Sons and continued to use their trade mark, name and factory at Spital Hill Works. They capitalized on the John Sorby &amp; Sons&apos; fame to the fullest.&lt;br /&gt;
Hanging Sheep, a sign he later hung over the entrance to his factory, was John Sorby&apos;s trade mark.</description>

            <title>E. C. Atkins Perfection No. 53 - Scew-Back Hand Saw, 26&quot; long, 10 ppi - c. 1910 by Daryl Weir</title>
            <description>&quot;Skillful mechanics everywhere instantly recognize the merits of this Saw&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
Here&apos;s a nice example of a late 1910 era Atkins &quot;SILVER STEEL&quot; No.53. It&apos;s a cross cut hand saw, filed at 10ppi, with the blade being 26&quot; long.&lt;br /&gt;
As you would expect, it has the embossed apple &quot;Perfection&quot; handle which Atkins started using, instead of the carved handle, around 1912.</description>

            <title>Big Ripsaw and Crosscut Saw Project by Dominic Greco</title>
            <description>I wanted to build a full sized rip and crosscut saws for a while now. Until recently I didn&apos;t have access to large widths of 0.042&quot; steel. But that changed and I was ready to work.&lt;br /&gt;
Along with that steel I also picked up a Beverly Slitting Shear. This little gem allows me to cut spring steel like it was paper. Now that all the pieces were in place I decided it was time to layout a rip and cross cut saw prototype. I used AutoCad to design the saw plates to meet the hang line of a couple of my favorite saw handles - the Wheeler Madden &amp; Clemson as well as the old Disston D-7. Once I had these laid out I printed out the plans and went to town on the saw plates.</description>

            <title>Building a Minstrel Banjo with Jason Stamper</title>
            <description>A few years ago I was camping with a friend of mine and he brought his minstrel banjo. After getting to play it I knew I had to have one, but funds were short. &lt;br /&gt;
So being the practical one, I decided to make one. My friend said I was nuts for trying since I could buy one for $200, but I decided to forge ahead anyway.</description>

            <title>Plane Maker’s Bed Float Reproduction by Jim Hendricks</title>
            <description>Part war of attrition... part friendship... and mostly encouragement was all I needed to get my backside out into the shop again and make a prototype tool… as suggested by a very good friend of mine Toby Nava.&lt;br /&gt;
So having absolutely no idea where to start a few more head scratchings and observations of other fine tools led me to make one… and by chance one for me too! (how clever was that!!)&lt;br /&gt;
Steel….O1... of course... 3mm ground gauge plate&lt;br /&gt;
Toby requested 6 1/2&quot; of tooth area and a total length of 8&quot; so that’s the dimensions. In retrospect... and if I ever make another..</description>

            <title>The Plot Thickens – The Berg Hand Tools Revisited by Kim Malmberg</title>
            <description>I have written several stories about the Erik Anton Berg manufacturing company. Mostly I have been engaged in trying to date company line of tools depending on stamps and logotypes.&lt;br /&gt;
Much new and hard evidence had surfaced since the previous stories, which has effectively crushed several loose theories. Which is all good. &lt;br /&gt;
This particular story will not be so much about the type study or dating Berg tools, as it is about the new findings which have occurred, very much regardless of my work, but through evidence brought forward by people such as my good friend Glen Crook in Canada, author of the website Galootopia, Randall Nelson, a collector of unusual chisels, but also through the Facebook group Gamla verktyg and the detective work by Fredrik Dahlstedt.</description>

            <title>Hand Plane Basics - part 1 by Bill Rittner</title>
            <description>I am often asked how to get started using handplanes. So, here goes.  &lt;br /&gt;
I chose the plane pictured below for this article because it is common and inexpensive. It is a modern Stanley #5 jack plane made in England. I bought it at a flea market for $7. &lt;br /&gt;
My purpose is to show you that just about any plane can be made to work well with some knowledge and work. The object of this article will be to make this plane work well not to make it look pretty.</description>

            <title>Making the Ron Herman&apos;s Sawbench by Naveen Gogineni</title>
            <description>The first time I ever heard of a saw bench was from a Chris Schwarz article on Popular Woodworking.  The one in the pdf in the article was an intimidating one for me because of the mortise &amp; tenon joints etc. &lt;br /&gt;
After doing a bunch of research I came across another saw bench, again by C. S., but with &quot;easier&quot; joints. &lt;br /&gt;
I&apos;ve been using that bench for many months now and I completely agree with Chris&apos;s statement that using a handsaw without a saw bench is like trying to use a router without securing your work. You can do it in a pinch, but your results usually suffer.</description>

            <title>Sorby: A Famous Sheffield Tool Making Family by Geoffrey Tweedale</title>
            <description>‘SORBY’ is a well-known name in Sheffield tool and cutlery manufacture.&lt;br /&gt;
The family was an old one, whose members became prominent in the town’s affairs as magistrates and local government officials. The first Master Cutler (the head of the local craft guild) in 1624 was Robert Soresby (the name has had various spellings). Other Sorbys later held that post. &lt;br /&gt;
By the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, several Sorby tool and cutlery businesses thrived in Sheffield. Their history is featured in tool reference books, on internet sites, and in company literature. &lt;br /&gt;
Much has been made of the family’s ancient links to the first Master Cutler, its worthy municipal record, its illustrious descendants (one of them was the scientist, Henry Clifton Sorby), and the longevity of its industrial activities.&lt;br /&gt;
Unfortunately, that reported history is incomplete. Moreover, the complex family and inter-firm linkages have bred endless confusion. Sorby’s business history therefore merits further investigation.</description>

            <title>Warran &amp; Ted demands some respect - II by Kim Malmberg</title>
            <description>This is a Warranted Superior hand saw. Nevertheless I will boldly state that it is one of the finest saws I have ever come across.&lt;br /&gt;
I cannot confirm the maker with absolute certainty, but the saw features a Warranted Superior medallion with the Disston keystone, so I’d be surprised if it was made by any other company.&lt;br /&gt;
Bear with me. The etch in my Supplee Hardware saw contains two rows of text identical, both in content and design, to a Woodrough McParlin hardware saw made for Sickels &amp; Nutting in Davenport, Iowa.</description>

            <description>The Isaac Youngs wall clock is a decidedly timeless piece.&lt;br /&gt;
The original clock, made by Youngs in the 1840 is in the collection of Hancock Shaker Village, Hancock Mass. Even though time seems to be my worst enemy these days, I thought I would have a go at making one. &lt;br /&gt;
The overall measurements I used for this clock came from Ejner Handberg’s second volume of Shop Drawings of Shaker Furniture and Woodenware. Mr. Handberg’s dimensions were documented from the original clock.</description>

            <title>Rosewood Tote Repair Step by Step by Dominic Greco</title>
            <description>I used a couple small pieces of rosewood to repair this rosewood tote.&lt;br /&gt;
Now before you ask, &quot;Why go through all this mess? Just make a new one!&quot;, I&apos;ll give you my reasons.&lt;br /&gt;
First off, I really don&apos;t like making totes. 
I can shape them pretty easily, but I consistently mess up the drilling for the counter bore at the top. The only way I can see to make it full proof is to buy a counterbore bit.</description>

            <title>James Howarth &amp; Sons Ltd. by Geoffrey Tweedale</title>
            <description>James Howarth (1811-1891) was the son of William Howarth, an edge tool maker, and his wife, Hannah. James’ uncle, John, had been involved in Mottram &amp; Howarth, an edge tool manufacturer, which had been listed in a directory in 1811 in Bridge Street.&lt;br /&gt;
In 1823, James had joined his father as a 12-year-old second hand or striker (forger) at another edge tool maker, Mitchell Bros, in Furnival Street. James ‘soon learned how to make a good chisel … and by the time he reached the age of 22 he had gained so much of the confidence of his employers that he was entrusted with the duties of manager’ (Sheffield Independent, 31 July 1891).</description>

            <description>I have been making replacement knobs and totes for planes for a number of years and through this article hope to pass on some of the knowledge I have gained over that time. Making a new tote is not too difficult for the average woodworker, but explaining the entire process is rather complicated. &lt;br /&gt;
So I have chosen to break this article up into several parts to make it easier to digest.</description>

            <title>Spot the Fake by Kim Malmberg</title>
            <description>I love hand saws. All of them.&lt;br /&gt;
In any shape and size. Since woodworking in my case is merely an excuse for dealing with rust I tend to spend most of my shop time working on saws, rather than with them. &lt;br /&gt;
Where I live I can rarely find any decent saws. Most of them are badly beaten with ugly or broken handles and damaged saw plates. Which means I have a stack of donor saws where one can provide a plate...</description>

            <title>Reviving a Traditional Tool Chest by Jason Stamper</title>
            <description>A few years ago I bought and read Chris Schwarz’s book “The Anarchists Tool Chest.” When I found this book I was in the process of making a tool box with a lift up front. Even as I was making this toolbox, I realized it would end up being far too small for my burgeoning tool collection.&lt;br /&gt;
After reading the book and thinking about it, I decided I would need to build my own tool chest. At this point I stopped working on the first toolbox, it’s still not finished, and started planning for the larger tool chest. As fate would have it I discovered a very heavy antique tool chest at my favorite rusty iron dealer. I talked him down to $60, and loaded it in the back of our Explorer; along with the two panel saws I bought that day. As I have often jokingly told my dear wife, I have an iron deficiency.</description>

It opens as pictured or folds flat. The design is actually much older than Andre Roubo (he wrote in the 1770s), it is a traditional form for supporting the family Quran. Searching the Internet for “Roubo Bookstand” will keep you busy for many hours.</description>

            <title>Re-cutting and Re-sizing Saw Teeth with Paul Sellers</title>
            <description>No matter the reason, this video show you how simple it is to cut new saw teeth in any handsaw. &lt;br /&gt;
Yes, that means from small dovetail saws to the largest hand saws you have. If you have a saw you ruined, then file off the teeth and reach for your junior hacksaw. You are on your way to a saw tooth re-cut you won&apos;t regret no matter the maker old and new. &lt;br /&gt;
I so hope you enjoy the work that went into this and that you like what I have done to reach out to real woodworkers around the world.</description>

            <title>Testing the “Richard Tomes” Memorial Infill Panel Plane by Jim Hendricks</title>
            <description>This week I finally had opportunity to get the plane tested by Douglas Coates of Coats England who is not only one of this country’s fine craftsmen in wood… but a good friend and a very honest critic of things wood in general, so I knew his views during testing would not be sugar coated!&lt;br /&gt;
His workshop in the heart of Sevenoaks is ideal for the test because it’s a “proper” workshop... unlike mine which is more akin to the set of Steptoe and Son!</description>

            <title>Building a 19th Century Style Parlor Guitar by Jason Stamper</title>
            <description>I have always been a good guitar player and it is my favorite instrument to play, so I decided to go for a 19th century parlor guitar.&lt;br /&gt;
The guitar is far more complex than the early banjo, but I was determined to give it a try. &lt;br /&gt;
This instrument is being based on a Martin 1-18 guitar plan, and is very small compared to a modern guitar.</description>

The fact that I prefer to work in wood had not escaped Richard’s keen eye… and also that I admired his wonderful work with creating dovetails in steel and anyone who has successfully done so in wood will know that doing this with steel is nothing short of alchemy!</description>

            <title>The Eleven Grooved Box – Tools Update by Jim Harvey</title>
            <description>I have an improved fixture for making Eleven Grooved Box splines. 

Roy Underhill’s video shows the spline blank placed in a grooved block. Then the blank is planed to size with a block plane.&lt;br /&gt;
The problem is, this eventually cuts some off the top surface of the grooved block causing the splines to come out too small. Then the splines won’t do their job well and look terrible.&lt;br /&gt;
My improved method has three secret weapons:&lt;br /&gt;
1. A Kerfing Plane to make the blanks&lt;br /&gt;
2. A modified Dado plane with skewed blade&lt;br /&gt;
3. A sizing block with a channel to guide the modified plane</description>

            <title>Building a Stair Saw by Dominic Greco</title>
            <description>I just started working on a new project in which I will build a stair saw based on an old Disston Stair saw loaned to me by Buckaroo. &lt;br /&gt;
I drew up the profile and made myself a temple of the handle. I also took the time to draw up a profile of the saw plate and get it&apos;s measurements down.&lt;br /&gt;
I used a caliper to measure the thickness of the sawplate and was sort of surprised to find that it was 0.032&quot; thk.&lt;br /&gt;
But I guess this would stand to reason since you would want a stiff saw plate for cuts where it was extended away from the handle.&lt;br /&gt;
Before really digging into the building process, I like to get all the raw material together and cut to rough size. Tonight I started on the saw plate.</description>

I really like the G-P hand drills. They are beautiful, and there&apos;s a sea of models to choose from. A very nice detail is that several G-P hand drill models are of the same size and were made with removable handles.</description>

            <title>Ratcheting Parallel Guide and Angled Leg Vises by Will Myers</title>
            <description>In Scott Landis’s &quot;The Work Bench Book&quot; there is a drawing of a ratchet mechanism
for a parallel guide.&lt;br /&gt;
It was one of those little tidbits I tend to file away in my head thinking I might try sometime. &lt;br /&gt;
In the book the guide is a solid piece of iron with teeth cut in the lower side that engage a plate mounted to the leg of the bench. &lt;br /&gt;
A simple foot lever arrangement raises the guide above the plate when you need to close up the chop of the vise.</description>

            <title>Coffeyville Kansas Patented Oiler Discovered in Oklahoma by Michael Urness</title>
            <description>Several years ago, while attending the SWTCA tool show in Tulsa Oklahoma, I had the good fortune to spend a few hours visiting with Tim Hoss, the show&apos;s host.&lt;br /&gt;
The day before the show started, Tim took me to his house to show me the progress being made on its remodeling. After walking thru the house, we retired to the garage where Tim&apos;s tools are temporarily being housed.&lt;br /&gt;
In one of the totes of planes was an Ohio Tool Co. No. 04 smooth plane that has a brass front knob. It didn&apos;t look like anything special. In fact it is a plane that I and many other tool collectors might have walked past if we had seen it on a table at a tool show.</description>

            <title>British Saws and Saw Makers from 1660 by Simon Barley</title>
            <description>My affair with English saws began a long time ago. Sometime around 1998 I met Ken Hawley  at his delectable tool shop in central Sheffield, renowned as the place that announced in the window &quot;We sell nowt [in local dialect &quot;nothing&quot;] but tools&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
Most of what I got there was new tools, but I also acquired from him the first set of hollows and rounds that helped me to get started on using moulding planes. I was by then several years into a major project of converting a 19th century stone barn into a house, and was more and more fascinated by the wonderful tools I could use – machinery frightened me, it made a terrible noise and dust, and it did not enable me to learn the feeling of the timber as I worked it.</description>

            <title>Saw Sharpening Bench by Bill Rittner</title>
            <description>For shop projects I don’t usually buy the materials, but try to use what I have, what I can repurpose, or can find from others discards. The first thing I found was the top. It is a high pressure laminated countertop that a cabinet maker in my building no longer wanted. &lt;br /&gt;
The leg stock is Douglas fir 4×4’s that I have had for many years. The oak board is door sill stock that I got from an estate cleanout several years ago. It will now be used for a shelf. In this case I did buy a Douglas fir 2x10x8 board because I needed apron stock and wanted to begin the project so I spent a few dollars on that. The final dimensions for the bench were driven by the already existing top which is 24 1/4 x 42 1/2.</description>

            <title>Special Etch Saws  by Kim Malmberg</title>
            <description>My largest hand tool fetish are saws. I have been using them since I was a child and I have always liked hand sawing, even when I got into power tools. So saws are always welcomed to my home, even when sound judgment tells me I shouldn&apos;t bother.&lt;br /&gt;
I might end up with some hopeless cases, some entirely useless ones, but sometimes even if the saw is beyond salvation, it might still provide something very useful. It might be parts, it might help my research regarding certain saw makers or it might reveal something unexpected.</description>

            <description>In another story on this website I mentioned that the Erik Anton Berg company made a lot more than just chisels and plane irons. Berg was also a prominent maker of pliers, amongst other things.&lt;br /&gt;
I have an unhealthy affection for those odd tools. I like files, knives, measure tapes, and I like pliers. They are a necessity when I restore old tools, but they are also beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;
So there’s no surprise then that I have found myself collecting pliers. I’m not fussy. I like American ones, English and German ones, but most of all I am always on the lookout for Berg pliers.</description>

            <title>The Ironmonger - The King of Hardware Trade Journals By Geoffrey Tweedale</title>
            <description>Anyone who has picked up an old saw, plane, or knife soon looks for a trade mark or maker’s name. These can identify and sometimes date an artefact. But one often wants to know more about the history of the manufacturer or individual. Reference books and other published sources – such as newspapers and directories – can sometimes provide a lead. But they do not usually give much detail. Ideally, business records – letters, accounts ledgers, and old pattern books – should help. But not many tool and cutlery enterprises have left an archive trail. So where does one look?&lt;br /&gt;
In the late 1970s, I pondered this question, when I was researching the 19th century Sheffield cutlery and tool trades. I tried trawling through consecutive years of one Sheffield newspaper, but soon gave this up as too laborious. Trade journals seemed to offer a more focused source, so I began looking at leading Victorian periodicals, such as The Engineer and Engineering. These were useful and the volumes were often indexed.</description>

            <title>Unusual Panel Saw - American Saw Co. by Wiktor Kuc and Joe Steiner</title>
            <description>Some time ago Joe Steiner (former partner at Sauer &amp; Steiner Toolworks) sent me this email:

&quot;Hey Wiktor,
I don&apos;t know if this interests you but here are some pics of a saw from a co. that is the first example I have seen (maybe you have some examples) but which I would think are relatively scarce. The saw was in rough shape and the etching was nowhere to be seen behind some very thick rust. I saw the handle in a pile of saws and it screamed special. Cleaned it a bit but didn&apos;t want to go too far.&lt;br /&gt;
It will never be a collector or even a user saw because of the unfortunate breakage on the nose but what a cool etch. I wonder if this was advertising in a useful form for their patented removable teeth in the circular blades that they may be more famous for. I don&apos;t know if you want to include it in the stuff you have on the American Saw co site.&quot;</description>

            <title>Eleven Grooved Box Step by Step - Part 1 and Part 2 by Jim Harvey</title>
            <description>I’ve made about a dozen of these now and will document the next batch here with photos. Most of the boxes I’ve made lately are in Cherry or Walnut and are pencil box size, 3″ x 8″. These next few will be larger, sized to hold 3″ x 5″ index cards.
&lt;br /&gt;
The lumber for this project is leftover tongue and groove wainscoat paneling from my fathers house circa 1974. These were milled 5″ wide and 11/16″ thick. He never finished the basement so after 35 years, some of the stock was available. The Cherry had darkened quite a bit and that had to be planed off to get an even color on both sides of the boards.</description>

            <description>I am a big fan of Roy Underhill’s “The Woodwright’s Shop”. Last fall was the 32nd season, and he’s still wearing the same hat. 

The second episode was titled “The Eleven Grooved Box”, a project Roy uses in his woodworking school. You can see it here. 

I was attracted to this project because he uses Stanley 45 combination planes to make all eleven grooves. 

I have a Stanley 45 and have been looking for an appropriate project so I am trying to duplicate what Roy does as closely as I can.</description>

            <title>Dovetail Saws Put to the New Tools Test by Peter Sefton</title>
            <description>Needing to equip seven student toolboxes with dovetail saws, Peter Sefton and his latest crop of budding furniture makers test eight of the best saws from Britain and beyond, with surprising results.&lt;br /&gt;
When new students come and join me at the workshop, the initial few days concentrate on tool selection, sharpening, fettling and general care of both new and existing tools. We also discuss in detail buying new kit, which for most tools is quite straightforward but I always find the Dovetail saw the most tricky to advise upon.</description>

            <title>Setting up a Cap Iron by Bill Rittner</title>
            <description>When fettling a plane for the first time a lot of attention is usually paid to the iron, or blade, and rightfully so.&lt;br /&gt;
 It&apos;s because no matter what else you do to a plane if the iron is not sharp the plane won’t function at its best.&lt;br /&gt;
The next most important part in the process is the cap iron, commonly known as the chip breaker.</description>

            <title>Building a full size #4 Dovetailed Infill Plane by Don Wilwol</title>
            <description>Making an infill plane has been on my list for quite some time now. Making tools to me is more of a hobby than the actual woodworking. &lt;br /&gt;
If you are looking to build an infill, you’re welcome to follow me along. I’ll try to keep the blog as up to date as time allows and would love feedback from others taking the same path.</description>

            <title>Greyhound Panel Saw No. 8 - 20&quot;, 11ppi, crosscut by Daryl Weir</title>
            <description>Here&apos;s a good example of a late 1890&apos;s to 1900 &quot;Golden Era&quot; George Bishop No. 8, 20&quot; panel saw with a very fine 11ppi crosscut configuration. &lt;br /&gt;
With it&apos;s cover top &amp; let-in handle, this saw was meant to directly compete with Disston&apos;s D8 saw at that time. Unfortunately, Bishop&apos;s No. 8 saws show up far less often than the D8.&lt;br /&gt;
Saws of 24 inches and smaller panel sized saws seem to be a little harder to come by than their bigger full size 26&quot; counterparts.</description>

            <title>Quick half-blind dovetails... the hard part by Zach Dillinger</title>
            <description>If you want to make realistic reproductions, don&apos;t listen to the modern nonsense that every surface is a show surface. &lt;br /&gt;
Period furniture (i.e. when things were done by hand with speed) shows many tool marks. A large number of 18th century furniture pieces I have studied exhibit deep saw overcuts on the drawer fronts. &lt;br /&gt;
Some of these extend an inch beyond the baseline and are quite deep into the face of the drawer. They aren&apos;t simply to release the outside corner as some posit... they are far deeper than required for that task.</description>

            <title>Woodrough &amp; McParlin Handsaw No. 55 Bow Belly by Daryl Weir</title>
            <description>I took a chance bidding on this one on eBay as it had quite a few broken teeth, about 30 in all when it got to my door! &lt;br /&gt;
I was the only one that bid on it as most figured it was probably a lost cause with the number of teeth gone in the pictures. I figured it was a No.55 Bow Belly by the handle shape and the plated hardware.&lt;br /&gt;
I couldn&apos;t even see an etch when I got the saw as the blade was covered in a pretty heavy dark brown to black rust. Here are a few pictures from eBay that shows the condition.</description>

            <title>Wards Master Quality Miter Box by Jason Stamper</title>
            <description>I was poking around one of my favorite junk shops a few years ago , and to my delight stumbled upon on old miter box.&lt;br /&gt;
It was rusty and missing quite a few parts, but it had a nice saw with it and good bones. For some unknown reason I did not take a picture of it when I got it, but it was rough! &lt;br /&gt;
I cleaned all the rust off, repainted the main castings, and replaced as many parts as I could find.</description>

            <title>Atkins &quot;SILVER STEEL&quot; No. 53 massive rip saw with 28 &quot; long blade - 1900 era by Daryl Weir</title>
            <description>Geo. H. Bishop was proud to say about his saws that they should cut with... &quot;Speed &amp; Ease&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
Here is a good user grade saw, 1900 era Atkins &quot;SILVER STEEL&quot; No.53. It&apos;s a massive rip saw with the 28&quot; long blade.  Lets see how it cuts...&lt;br /&gt;
The edge has a very good crowning breast to it, just like the day it left the Atkins plant in Indianapolis. The edge did have some dings in it which I have worked out to the best of my ability. While I&apos;m not going to say it&apos;s pin straight, it&apos;s usable straight or I wouldn&apos;t be selling it.</description>

            <title>Channel Moldings by Zach Dillinger</title>
            <description>Channel moldings are commonly seen on seventeenth and early eighteenth century furniture.&lt;br /&gt;
They are very simple to do, yet add a nice shadow line that helps to break up an otherwise plain surface, which in this case is the four side rails for my poly chrome bevel molded dresser.&lt;br /&gt;
The channel molding is made up of a groove with molded features flanking either side of the groove. Ovolos, cavettos, ogees, and simple roundovers are seen.  These are usually done with a scratch stock and can be done after assembly if so desired.</description>

            <title>Bishop&apos;s Bulldog Toolbox Saw No. 200 and Disston&apos;s Advertising Blitz by Wiktor Kuc</title>
            <description>Sometime around 1915 Geo. H. Bishop company introduced a saw designed for a toolbox.&lt;br /&gt;
They named it a Bishop&apos;s Bulldog Toolbox Saw.&lt;br /&gt;
According to advertisements, the reason to this specialized type of saw was series of laws enacted to improve safety of surroundings when tools are in transport.</description>

            <title>The New Flooring Saw by Geo. H. Bishop - from The National Builder, Vol. 50, February 1910, (Porter, Taylor &amp; Co., Chicago, 1910)</title>
            <description>In this age of fine hardwood floors and beautiful interior finish, the saw plays an important part. &lt;br /&gt;
The carpenter or workman needs a saw that will do the work accurately and quickly and without the aid of other tools to start the job with. The accompanying illustration shows the new floor saw that Geo. H. Bishop &amp; Co. are placing on the market. One glance at the illustration will tell our readers what this new saw should accomplish&lt;br /&gt;
 The reputation of the manufacturers is back of this saw guaranteeing that it will do everything it should, and live up - in quality and workmanship - to the Greyhound trademark placed upon every saw blade.</description>

            <title>How do you know when your tools are sharp? by Zach Dillinger</title>
            <description>The necessity of having a sharp chisel or plane iron with which to do your work is almost universally recognized (a very rare thing in the world of woodworking!). &lt;br /&gt;
Sure, you can muddle through a job with half-sharp tools, but sooner or later a dull-ish tool will negatively impact your work (or your finger!) as you try to force the tool to do work for which it is not prepared.</description>

            <description>Some years ago in the early summer I found a guy on Craigslist getting rid of a bunch of old tools and decided to go check them out. I ended up getting a little cache of nice things, my favorite of which was a sweet gem of a saw that I noticed sticking out of the bottom of a box of rust. &lt;br /&gt;
All I could make out in the darkness of this guys basement was the finely shaped upper horn of a small back saw but that was enough for me. &lt;br /&gt;
I quickly fell in love with it and took it home despite its sorry condition. Here she was as found...</description>

            <description>A few figured apple handles come along once in a while on vintage saws but for the most part are few and far between. This has got to be one of the better ones I&apos;ve seen and the pictures really don&apos;t do it justice.&lt;br /&gt;
It is installed on a late 1900 early 1910 era Simonds No.5, which is similar in looks to the Disston No.12, but not near as common. The original owner must have treasured it enough to scribe his name on the back side close to the handle.</description>

            <title>Plane Bevel Ups and Downs - with Paul Sellers</title>
            <description>A plane skims off many years of developed change and transforms roughness in touch to smoothness and the shapeless to shaped. It&apos;s hard to convey the impression a cutting edge brings to wood even though we live surrounded by its impact. &lt;br /&gt;
Millions of trillions of cuts undulate on the surfaces of wood around the world and we walk unconsciously by them. &lt;br /&gt;
I&apos;ve made millions of them myself using planes hundreds of years old and new.</description>

            <title>Oh, please make your mind up, Mr. Berg! by Kim Malmberg</title>
            <description>It was one of those late workshop evenings. The house was silent, I should have been fast asleep in my bed, but I was enjoying the moment and was rummaging around for a suitable cutter for an ongoing project. &lt;br /&gt;
I had been experimenting with adding thick vintage cutters to metal hand planes, and I was particularly looking for a 2 inch Erik Anton Berg cutter of good length. It turned out I had several so I started comparing them.</description>

            <title>The Antiquity of Trade Marks - The British Trade Journal, Vol. 18, 1880</title>
            <description>The question has been asked by somebody, How old are trade-marks?&quot; who answers it by saying that they seem to be nearly as old as the industry of the race.&lt;br /&gt;
For instance: Ancient Babylon had property symbols, and the Chinese claim to have had trade-marks 1,000 years before Christ. Guttenberg, the very inventor of printing, had a lawsuit about a trade-mark, and he won it.</description>

            <title>Bench Plane - How it&apos;s Made...</title>
            <description>The various surfacing planes are nearly alike, as regards the arrangement of the iron, the principal differences being in their magnitudes. &lt;br /&gt;
Thus the maximum width is determined by the average strength of the individual, and the difficulty of maintaining with accuracy the rectilinear edge. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Fabricating in Aluminum by Bob Smalser</title>
            <description>As a boatbuilder by training who often has to fabricate custom hardware, I designed and made another rifle racks that’s a bit heavier and shorter, grips the much stand better, and is totally spill-proof. &lt;br /&gt;
As an ex-Army competitive shooter who is now a volunteer coach for a large junior program teaching Olympic small-bore, I’m constantly looking for ways to reduce the distractions and inefficiencies of match preparation, and getting the rifle off the ground to speed buttplate and sight adjustments is an excellent example.</description>

            <title>Reagan by Matt Cianci</title>
            <description>1874 was a very busy year at the Keystone Saw Works, the hub of Henry Disston and Sons mammoth saw and tool making enterprise. &lt;br /&gt;
Among many patents granted that year and utilized on new Disston saws was the ‘Improvement in handles for saws’ feature granted to William J. Reagan on December 8. The Reagan patent handle was found on the Disston No. 9 improved backsaw, which featured a decorative ogee shaped on the nose of the saw blade, as well as the standard Disston #4 backsaw with a square nose.</description>

            <description>Here is a No. 72, 28&quot; 5ppi rip saw, 1910 era. The teeth are &quot;graduated&quot; from butt to point, starting at 5ppi and going down to 6ppi at the point. &lt;br /&gt;
Here&apos;s a little side note for the saw purchaser to look for: there is usually a 1 ppi graduation on 5 1/2 ppi and coarser rips saws and it is something one needs to always look for.</description>

            <title>The Care, Selection and Proper Fitting of Hand Saws by Charles Johnson, 1909</title>
            <description>During 1905 and 1904 the writer was Engineer for Porter Brothers of Spokane, on their contracts in connection with the construction of the Puget Sound Power Company&apos;s Plant at Electron, Washington.
One of the contracts called for the construction oi e box flume 8 feet square. The work of building 8-l/2 miles of this flume was sublet to the Northwest Bridge Company of Tacoma.&lt;br /&gt;
The bottom of the flume was double, being made of 2 inch plank lined with l inch stuff. The flume was built on true circular curves, the sides being sprung to place. The last board on each side of the bottom, both of the main floor and the lining had to be scribed to fit the sides and then ripped. After several unsuccessful attempts to do this work with power saws it was decided to do it by hand.</description>

            <title>Gauges and Other Tools - Shop Talks with the Young Mechanics by W. H. Vandervoort, 1899</title>
            <description>There is nothing more confusing to the young mechanic than the use of the several systems of gauges used in designating the sizes of wire, machine screws, drills and plate thickness. Unfortunately, most of these dimensions differ from each other for corresponding numbers by comparatively small amounts, yet an amount sufficient to cause error if the one is mistaken for the other. &lt;br /&gt;
The following table gives for comparison values for only a few numbers under each of the several gauges in most common use.</description>

            <title>1870 era, 10&quot; Disston&apos;s Jackson Fine 15PPI Blued Back Saw - Historically Significant  by Daryl Weir</title>
            <description>This is a historically significant Jackson 10&quot; back saw made by Disston. It&apos;s from the mid to later part of the 1870 period. The dating is based on screws used to fasten the handle. These are small thread diameter, Disston centennial screws.&lt;br /&gt;
They were patented by Henry Disston and featured domed head and a capped nut that covered the end of the male-end of the screw.</description>

            <title>Decoding Smith’s ‘Key’ by Matthew Cianci</title>
            <description>Joseph Smith was an English engraver working around the turn of the 18th century, and he is noted as having produced one of the Western world’s first tool catalogs, called formally, ‘Explanation or key, to the various manufactories of Sheffield, with engravings of each article’. &lt;br /&gt;
He was not a tool maker, or dealer, as far as we can tell (Kebabian, 1975), and he was not a cabinet maker, joiner, or even a woodworker. Quite ironic then, that his work stands as perhaps the one of the most important historical records of the tools of period woodworkers.</description>

            <title>Hand Saw Re-work by Will Myers</title>
            <description>My favorite hand saws are the older ones, particularly the ones made later in the 19th and early 20th centuries.&lt;br /&gt;
In my opinion this was the golden age of the handsaw. The blades were taper ground of good quality steel, the totes were shapely, looked nice, and were actually made to fit a human hand. There are still plenty of these saws around but are getting more expensive and a bit more scarce. &lt;br /&gt;
The saws made after these in the later 1900’s turn up quite often and are usually cheap. Most of these have good quality blades but the totes look and fit you hand terrible. I usually pass these saws up because totes will almost give you a blister just looking at them.</description>

            <title>Hand Drill No. 2A Transitional by Wiktor Kuc</title>
            <description>The hand drill No. 2A was introduced by Millers Falls Company around 1957.(1)  My collection of catalogs does not go beyond 1949, consequently the description of this drill is based on data from the catalog released by Millers Falls Tool Co., an entity organized in 1982.  &lt;br /&gt;
The Ingersoll-Rand Company, the owner of Millers Falls Company prior to 1982, sold all hand tool business to this new entity.  The description and image below is from the catalog published by this new organization - a Millers Falls Tool Co.&lt;br /&gt;
Major differences between this 1857 model and preceding 1938 edition are in the type of metal used for the frame, casting method of the frame, the size and appearance of the frame, and the spindle diameter.

The No. 2 drill released in 1938 and produced until 1857, (the introduction year of No. 2A) is made of malleable, sand-cast iron later machined to affect a few areas of the frame.</description>

            <title>Stainless Cutlery and the History of Portland Works in Sheffield by Geoffrey Tweedale</title>
            <description>In 2013, Sheffield celebrated an important centenary – the discovery of stainless steel for cutlery. The anniversary was duly marked by various events, exhibitions, and publications. It was an opportunity to reflect on the individuals and companies involved in this revolutionary breakthrough.&lt;br /&gt;
The steel and cutlery firms that shaped the introduction of stainless steel a hundred years ago have long since disappeared. Indeed - although one hardly dare whisper it - Sheffield no longer manufactures forged table-knife blades (though a handful of firms, it is true, continue to market cutlery). However, factory buildings last longer than people.</description>

These dates are significant. The year 1740 marks the beginning of the commercial production of crucible steel and 2013 marks the centenary of the discovery of stainless steel for the production of cutlery (and tools).</description>

            <title>Filing a Lamb’s Tongue... by Matthew Cianci</title>
            <description>So I recently acquired a nice old Disston #7 in need of a handle from one of my Woodnet connections (Thanks Dave!) &lt;br /&gt;
Judging from the medallion and etch, which is clearly visible, I’d say it dates from just before the turn of the century.&lt;br /&gt;
Prior to my taking possession, it seems that the previous owner out of spite, or perhaps a sick sense of humor, installed a tote on this poor old saw that more resembled an oven mit than a device to comfortably operate and control the saw blade. Thankfully though the devious bastard did at least retain the original nuts and said medallion in the installation.</description>

I rummaged through some boxes of off-cuts out in the shed this morning. It was a bit of a chore just getting to the shed, as the ice storm we had last night froze the gate shut, and I had to clamber over the fence to get into the back yard, and then hammer the ice off the shed door to get in.</description>

            <description>Last winter I took a day off of work and hung out with Peter Follansbee at his shop at Plimoth Plantation.&lt;br /&gt;
Peter and I had become friendly through the Lie-Nielsen Hand Tool Events around New England, and I had sharpened a couple of saws for him. In the course of talking tools and shop, Peter showed me his saws. One of them was a nice 14 inch backsaw that he used occasionally for bench work like cutting tenon shoulders. I asked him how he liked it, and he said that he had some difficulty using it and that it was a bit uncomfortable.</description>

            <title>Brass and Walnut Try Square by Will Myers</title>
            <description>When you think about basic woodworking tools, a square of some kind would have to be at the top the list.&lt;br /&gt;
There are several different styles of square to choose from, my favorite that I use for most everything is a basic wood and metal try square. The all wood try squares are simple to make and seem to be accurate and are excellent for layout with a pencil.</description>

            <title>The Sharp Priorities… by Matthew Cianci</title>
            <description>When it comes to teaching saw sharpening, I generally recommend students follow a hierarchy while developing their skills.&lt;br /&gt;
By suggesting where to focus their attention first, it helps new filers get their saws sharp and cutting true with the shortest learning curve.&lt;br /&gt;
First, make sure all of the teeth are the same height. Jointing the saw before sharpening creates a visual “flat” on each tooth that guides this process. File until the flat is gone, but not a micro-spec further.</description>

            <title>Shaker-inspired Bookcase - part 2 by Will Myers</title>
            <description>The two doors are the next thing to make. These doors are made from 7/8 in stock that was clear and as straight grained as possible.&lt;br /&gt;
I cut the stiles a bit longer than needed so as to leave a little extra on the ends to help keep from spitting them when chopping the end mortises.&lt;br /&gt;
I clamped the four door stiles together and laid out the length of the doors and the rail locations first. Next, I laid out the length of the mortises for each of the three rails; by clamping all four stiles together for the layout assures both doors are identical to one another and the mortises line up perfectly.</description>

            <title>Making a Modified D-23 Replica Disston Hand Saw by Joe DiPietro</title>
            <description>My wanting to make this replica began several years ago. The first saw I’d ever touched occurred 55 years past in my mom and dad’s shop—and that was a skewback D-20, crosscut saw.&lt;br /&gt;
Even as little as I was, I was drawn to the shape of it’s tote (no, I didn’t know the term for the handle was “tote” then); but I watched as Dad used it, I clearly recall how Dad’s “ballet” of using it mesmerized me.</description>

            <title>Sharpening Chisels and Some Comments by P. Michael Henderson</title>
            <description>I teach hand cut dovetails and the students use my chisels to chop out the waste. So after each class, I have to go through my chisels and sharpen the ones the students used.&lt;br /&gt;
Over the years, I&apos;ve tried different techniques for sharpening and have settled on a technique which I find to be fast and produces an excellent edge.&lt;br /&gt;
I use certain equipment in the sharpening process, and while some of it is expensive, it&apos;s generally a once in a lifetime purchase.</description>

            <description>Last month I was at Plimoth Plantation teaching saw sharpening to the carpenters in the museum, along with Peter Follansbee (joiner in residence) and Mark Achison (presiding blacksmith). It was a blast. &lt;br /&gt;
One of several highlights of the day was when Mark pulled out some old saws that had been in the museum’s collection for a while. He knew nothing about them.</description>

            <description>Hold the handle in your vise and heat the ferrule to red hot. There will be a lot of smoke and flames. &lt;br /&gt;
As soon as the wood inside the ferrule has cooked enough, you can pull the blade out with your fingers.&lt;br /&gt;
You don&apos;t have to heat the shaft, and if you like you can wrap it with a wet cloth during the ferrule heating.</description>

            <title>Louis Cubes by P. Michael Henderson</title>
            <description>Louis cubes are a striking veneer pattern but one that&apos;s somewhat difficult to accomplish. It requires great accuracy in cutting the pieces so jigs and/or spacers are needed to help cut the elements to the right size.&lt;br /&gt;
Louis cubes are named for Louis XIV of France because the cubes were popular on furniture during his reign. But the cubes go back much further in antiquity.</description>

            <description>I have a book problem. I have books stored all over the house; in drawers, boxes, closets and other places.&lt;br /&gt;
The trouble comes when I need a particular book I end up having to hunt thru my various book stashes around the house to find the one I am looking for. &lt;br /&gt;
My book hunting routine is starting to get old. My lovely wife who is a very organized person is also getting tired of my little book problem too. I have been thinking about bookcase building for a while, but had not decided on what to build.</description>

            <description>Next I worked on preparing for the glue up. Since there are three doors that make up this glue-up, I need to construct something that will hold the doors in place during the press. &lt;br /&gt;
I start by cutting a piece of plywood larger than the three doors. Since this will go into a vacuum bag, I like to smooth any sharp edges.</description>

            <title>Disassemble a Yankee Pushdrill by James D. Thompson</title>
            <description>I recently acquired a Yankee push drill which didn&apos;t want to function properly. I think it is a #41, but someone thought it proper to take the tool to a grinder and grind off the surface of the marked part of the barrel. I am going to presume that this was done to obliterate some owner&apos;s mark. I buffed up the damage a little so it wouldn&apos;t be quite so ugly.&lt;br /&gt;
I wanted to disassemble this beast to give it a good cleaning and oiling, but I could find no information on the internet that was useful. So I did what any good Galoot would do, I went at it in blissful ignorance. But I did take pictures, and I&apos;ll tell you how to do it. Here is a picture of the tool disassembled.</description>

            <title>A Moxon for Everyone by Scott Grandstaff</title>
            <description>I just finished a new vise. But really this vise is 40 years old. Or rather, parts of it are 40 years old. &lt;br /&gt;
Back when rocks were squishy, I was young and poor (still poor just not young anymore) I realized I needed a vise in the worst way. I was just starting out. I had nothing. Vises weren&apos;t exactly falling from the rooftops. &lt;br /&gt;
I grabbed some big all-thread and a scrap of 2X8. I put together something in a couple of days, which is fast considering I was coming from nowhere. It was my main and only vise and I didn&apos;t know any better.</description>

            <title>A Real Fish Story by Kim Malmberg</title>
            <description>Most woodworkers will recognize the tool maker Erik Anton Berg of Eskilstuna, Sweden. The Berg brand is well know across the globe.&lt;br /&gt;
Most people would also be able to recognize the Berg tools simply by their logo, an outlined shark.&lt;br /&gt;
Or, was it a fish? Actually, it was both.&lt;br /&gt;
No, it wasn&apos;t a genetic manipulation. It wasn&apos;t both at the same time. But when Erik Anton Berg started the company he chose a fish as the company logo, more specifically a Wels catfish, also known as sheatfish. The latin name is Sirulus Glanis.</description>

            <title>Re-casting Rings on a John Fray (Spofford) Brace by Will Myers</title>
            <description>The Spofford style brace is by far my favorite bit brace. &lt;br /&gt;
They are so simple yet so perfect. You can change bits with a quick twist of the wing nut, Spofford’s are also lighter weight than most braces. &lt;br /&gt;
The Spofford chuck was patented in 1859. John S. Fray &amp; Company started making these braces the same year, Stanley bought out Fray in 1920 and continued to produce them into the 1940’s.&lt;br /&gt;
Being as simple as they are there is no too much to go wrong with them. One problem I have noticed on a lot of them is the pewter rings that hold the handle halves together are either loose or broken. I think the rings are a nice detail on these braces and decided to figure out a way to fix them. I had a couple of braces that needed the rings repaired; here is what I came up with.</description>

            <description>All the skews I have bought have been at least 1/4” thick. &lt;br /&gt;
I thought I was sharpening them correctly, but obviously, I was not. I recently came across a thin skew, and it changed my life. &lt;br /&gt;
I decided to make one. I used a piece of High Speed Steel power hacksaw blade, It is about 1” wide and 3/32&apos; thick. I cut piece about 6” long and ground off the teeth.</description>

            <title>A Little Box by Will Myers</title>
            <description>Mr. Webster’s definition of a box is: a rigid typically rectangular container with or without a cover.&lt;br /&gt;
Small boxes are always an enjoyable project. They do not require much material and if you keep it fairly simple they do not take long to make. Finding a use for them is never a problem either. &lt;br /&gt;
If you like to cut dovetails they are excellent practice projects; if you make a bad mistake all you need is another scrap of wood to make a replacement piece.</description>

            <title>My 1830&apos;s Plated English Bit Brace by Jason Stamper</title>
            <description>Here is my 1830&apos;s plated English bit brace. Most likely manufactured by Henry Brown after he bought out James Bee.&lt;br /&gt;
The body is beech with a lignum top pad. Also, I wanted to share 2 countersink bits including one rare Abbott bit, patent from 1871. Thanks for watching and feel free to comment or ask questions!</description>

            <title>Parallel-jawed Wrench in Finland by Kim Malmberg</title>
            <description>I&apos;m a keen follower of the always insightful posts on wkfinetools.com.  When I saw Wiktor&apos;s story about the wrench a light went on in my head.  I had seen this one before.  In fact I owned one strikingly similar to the one he writes about.&lt;br /&gt;
Long story short, Wiktor has kindly asked me to write about my own wrench. Well, I&apos;m sorry to say I have little to offer regarding the intended use, the maker or when my wrench was made.</description>

            <title>Pexto Samson Brace Repair by Adam Maxwell</title>
            <description>Pexto Samson Braces&lt;br /&gt;
I&apos;m torn on whether to advertise how great the Pexto Samson braces are, because they can still fly under the radar on eBay, unlike the more-popular Yankee braces. However, the Pexto braces are one of the nicest-looking heavy-duty braces made, in my opinion, and the Samson chuck is superb.&lt;br /&gt;
The Samson chuck was Pexto&apos;s top-of-the-line chuck, with a ball-bearing head and the ability to hold round or tanged bits. Pexto claimed that it “Has tighest grip and easiest release of any Brace Chuck made.” in their 1923 catalog. In my experience, they work as advertised, and you actually have to be careful not to overtighten.&lt;br /&gt;
Braces with the Samson chuck include the 8000 and 8200 series, which are identical except for the enclosed ratched on the less-common 8200. Both feature ball bearing head and brass-bushed center handle, and were nickel-plated. Cocobolo and “tropical hardwood” were used in earlier and later models, respectively, and A, B, C, D, or E was appended to the model number as changes were made.</description>

            <title>The Table Saw ? by Matthew Cianci</title>
            <description>The debate over what the heck a table saw should be used for has raged for a while now.&lt;br /&gt;
I made one a while ago (here and here) and have been using it around the house and in my shop since then, and whether or not I know what it was truly designed for, its proven to be very handy. &lt;br /&gt;
Yesterday I had an hour or so to build the carcase for a utility cabinet to go around the electrical panel in our basement.</description>

            <title>Moravian Workbench Class by Will Myers</title>
            <description>A few weeks back I taught my first woodworking class at the Woodright’s School in Pittsboro, NC. &lt;br /&gt;
Sometimes things happen you really never expect; teaching a class at St. Roy’s Cathedral was not something I ever thought I would be doing.&lt;br /&gt;
With so many great woodworkers in the world and Roy picks me… go figure?
I am not going to go into great detail on the construction process. The building techniques and materials we used were basically the same as what I wrote about here last year.</description>

            <title>Box for Marquetry Trays - part 1 by P. Michael Henderson</title>
            <description>I made several marquetry trays over the past year or so and now need to have a box to store them in. This page documents the project of building the box.&lt;br /&gt;
7/1/2013 When I made the party stands (pictures below) I knew that I wanted to build a case for storing them. I didn&apos;t know exactly what I&apos;d do but I had some ideas. Now that I finished the stands, it&apos;s time to start on the storage box.&lt;br /&gt;
My original idea was to build a box that would also function as an end table on the side of a sofa. The box would have a door, and inside would be &quot;slots&quot; which the folded-up stands would slide into.</description>

            <description>About two years ago I saw this wrench on eBay. 

The description was rather enigmatic, but the look of it was eye-catching: &quot;Collectible, unusual old vintage double-sided adjustable wrench. Antique, rare tool.&quot; It sold for $45.00. I didn’t bid on it, but saved a few pictures.</description>

            <title>How I file a Saw by Matthew Cianci</title>
            <description>A recent customer asked if I would document the process of taking his old Disston D-8 (below) and share pics with him. I agreed and thought it would also make a great post. I’ll try to let the pics do the talking.&lt;br /&gt;
Before I can file and sharpen I needed to smith the saw to remove a bit of a kink and bow. To do this I keep pressure on the plate by bending it down on the anvil and use a specially modified hammer.</description>

            <title>So you want to learn how to use a sash fillister? by Zach Dillinger</title>
            <description>This question came up recently on one of the woodworking forums I frequent.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I took a few photos demonstrating why you need a sash fillister for sash work. It doesn&apos;t see much work outside of that specialty, but it can come in handy for moldings.﻿</description>

            <title>Mitered Breadboard Ends by Adam Maxwell</title>
            <description>Last fall, it seemed that our oldest (9 at the time) would benefit from a desk of his own, so I started looking at images of vintage school desks using Google’s image search. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The style that seemed best-suited is a simple desk with an sloping top that lifts up to reveal storage.  Since I had poplar on hand, I built the desk from that. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The front legs were turned on a pole lathe, and the drawbored mortise-and-tenon joinery was all done by hand.  The intent from the outset was to paint the base, but I wanted a natural wood top, and poplar is too soft for a good writing surface.</description>

            <title>Restoring a 14” Disston backsaw by Ethan Sincox</title>
            <description>When I bought a Craftsman miter box off of Craig’s List, one of the reasons I wanted it was because of the backsaw that came with it.

Experience has shown me I like the fit and feel of Disston backsaw totes from the turn of the (last) century. As soon as I got it home, I cleaned up the medallion and the saw back a bit (just enough to read them). 

After a little research and measuring, I concluded I had picked up a 12 TPI 14” Disston backsaw with an applewood tote and an 1896-1917 medallion.</description>

            <title>Joseph Smith’s Carcase Saw by Matthew Cianci</title>
            <description>In his own words, Matt Cianci admits that he is a fanatical lover of saws...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The last two weeks have been a bit of a blur (I was sick), but somewhere in the mix I managed to finally finish my carcase saw based on Joseph Smith’s ‘Key to the Manufactories of Sheffield’, a work I have obsessed over for years thanks to its images of early 19th century handsaws.

The moment the wax was dry on the tote, I started grabbing anything and everything in my shop to try out the cut….scrap wood, electrical cords, small animals, even a vagrant that likes to hang out in my neighborhood and wanders into my shop occasionally….they all went under the teeth of my new saw to test its metal. And what fun I had!!!</description>

            <title>Spier &amp; Co., No. 12 - large 28&quot;, 4 1/2ppi rip saw by Daryl Weir</title>
            <description>Here&apos;s a nice split nut, straight back, No.12 Spier &amp; Co. large 28&quot; 4 1/2ppi rip saw hailing from the Victorian era of the late 1860&apos;s to early 1870&apos;s. 

This second line of saw was made by firm of Wheeler, Madden &amp; Clemson of the Monhagen Saw Works, in Middletown, New York.  

The company later became a part of the National Saw Company in about 1890.  By 1893 the National Saw Co. included Harvey Peace, Woodrough &amp; McParlin, and Richardson Bros., all of which had been later absorbed by the behemoth H. Disston &amp; Sons.</description>

            <title>Rehabilitating Craftsman Miter Box by Ethan Sincox</title>
            <description>Recently, I stumbled across a Craig’s List ad for an old Craftsman miter box. I opened the link and checked it out. &lt;br /&gt;
It was just what I was looking for – a simpler model, similar to the Stanley 150, with the overarm saw guides, but without the length gauge. It was a deal at $18.&lt;br /&gt;
The fact that it came with a 14” Disston back saw, with what looked to be a solid, chip-free applewood tote in the late 1800/early 1900 style that I like so much, made it a doubly good deal! I’ll write up something on restoring the backsaw a bit later; for now, let’s focus on that miter box.</description>
