            <title>Making of an Ebony and Boxwood Square by Jim Hendricks</title>
            <description>After making the ebony and boxwood mini jack I had some small off-cuts.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Normally these would be chucked in the scrap box but such is the value of these fine woods that even small pieces need to be made into something. So I set about making my version of the Moxon/Roubo square as depicted in their drawings.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A remarkably easy job you&apos;d think but to get it accurate needs care and attention.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>The Hardware Cabinet - part 2 by Will Myers</title>
            <description>The original hardware cabinet seems to have been made entirely from old crating and cigar boxes. Most of its various parts have the remains of labels, writing and empty nail holes. So, in other words, it was built from scrap. There are several different species of wood but the great majority is old growth white pine. There are also a few drawer sides made of poplar and cypress. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
One positive to building a cabinet like this is that other than the case itself, you can utilize short scrap pieces of wood. The cabinet I am building here is made entirely of white pine. I use white pine a lot and have pretty good scrap pile of short pieces I can’t seem to throw away. One recommendation I would make is that whatever kind of wood you use, choose a softwood. Softwoods can handle nailing without pre drilling for the most part and are much easier to cut dados in. This thing has a bunch of nails and dados!&lt;br /&gt;</description>

            <title>My Study of Plane Fences Continuing by James E. Price</title>
            <description>Thanks to a bitterly cold day, I got in some good shop time and continued my study of plane fences that can be made for less than $5.00. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Some beginners may want an edge trimming plane but do not want to spend $75-$150 for a Stanley 95 or a Lie Nielson equivalent. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This one I made out of Sepele wood. I also dug around in my vintage hardware stash and found two brass finials to adorn the mahogany jointer fence I made yesterday. Both fences work perfectly in planing edges of boards for joining. Consider making one; you&apos;ll like using it.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

            <title>Joiner Plane Fence on the Budget by James E. Price</title>
            <description>I recently wrote a post on detachable fences for jointer planes. All of the examples in the post were manufactured.   &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Most of them are collectible and rather expensive for a beginning unplugged woodworker on a fixed budget which got me in the mindset to design and make a fence for less than $5.00.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It had to be simple and require no metalworking. It had to be designed so it would stay tightly secured to the plane and be exactly 90 degrees to the sole. The piece of hardware I settled on to accomplish this is an elevator bolt. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

            <title>Plum Moulding Plane by Richard Arnold</title>
            <description>Not all moulding planes are made of Beech.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This early 18th century moulding plane is made of Plum wood. Quite a few early planes turn up made of various fruit woods. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This example also sports a rather unusual wedge shape as well. The round profile is nicely marked out with a compass. It is also another example of a plane with the &quot;IC&quot; mark. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

            <title>Center Marking Gauges by James E. Price</title>
            <description>Thank all of you for your interest in the dovetail gauges I discussed in my post sometime ago.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I looked around my bench for other layout tools that might interest you and settled on center marking gauges that I use frequently to scribe a line or mark a point in the exact center of a board.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
These are highly akin to common marking gauges that scribe a line parallel go an edge but these instantly find center and scribe a line parallel to both edges.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

            <title>Plow Plane Arm Repair by Jim Harvey</title>
            <description>Broken planes is a subject that comes up often in the Facebook Unplugged Woodworking group.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Stripped threads are common on wooden planes that use threaded arms to position a fence. They usually break next to the arm’s foot as that is where the fence is most often needed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This is my example, it will be my repair experiment. Years ago I demoted it to a kerfing plane by replacing both skates with a blade cut from an old rip saw. I screwed an inch and a half spacer block on the fence to skip over the defective threads, which worked, but is awkward and heavy. I’m going to simply cut out the defective section, which will shorten the range of the plane, but who plows grooves six inches out anyway.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

            <title>Knight after Knight by Jim Hendricks</title>
            <description>This month me and Ron Harper made a deal - a Belgian coticule for a Steve Knight&apos;s moving fillister, a left handed one!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A grand deal for both of us and for Her Majesty who managed to squirrel money out of me to let it in the country! Someone should tell the Border control chaps that we have a &quot;special relationship!&quot; Still, I am absolutely thrilled.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Those of you who may not be familiar with KNIGHT TOOLWORKS may think them primitive but Steve was a rare genius, akin to Krenov, caring more for fine functionality and performance than esthetics.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

            <title>Stanley 386 &quot;Cheater&quot; Fence by James E. Price</title>
            <description>My New Year&apos;s resolution is to finish some little projects that I started but never finished.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Last November I bought a Stanley 386 cheater fence for jointing because it has screw holes in it for the mounting of a wooden addition to the metal fence.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I selected a piece of scrap Sepele wood and put it with the 386 fence and that is as far as I got. So, I grabbed some time this afternoon and made the wooden face for the fence.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

            <title>Very Old Chisel by Richard Arnold</title>
            <description>This hexagonal socket chisel was made by the edge tool maker, Samuel Freeth, and probably dates to somewhere between 1680 to 1710.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This type of socket was short lived in England and probably died out when edge tool manufacture moved from the Black Country to Sheffield in the mid 18th century.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

            <title>English Gunmetal Chariot Plane by James E. Price</title>
            <description>This English gunmetal chariot plane with ebony infill recently found a home with me.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

The front ebony infill is flush, or overstuffed, on one side but on the other side it is totally inside the body. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I think some previous owner sawed the overstuff off that side but it was done long, long ago. I have used chariot planes like this many years and I see no advantage if having an asymmetrical front bun.</description>

            <title>My Favorite Things by James E. Price</title>
            <description>Various craftsmen have posted photos of their favorite tools which inspired me to pick some of the tools which are essential in making dovetails.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Without proper gauges the layout chore is difficult as I learned long ago attempting to lay out tails with an adjustable miter square.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Over the years I have purchased and made the gauges in the first four photos. The second photo shows those I have made out of scraps. The one on the upper right in the second photo has an inlay of ebony and deer bone that interlock with dovetails.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

            <title>The Hardware Cabinet - part 1 by Will Myers</title>
            <description>One thing my wife I have both always enjoyed to do together is visit antique shops. I am always on the lookout for old tools and furniture.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I do pick up an occasional tool, but as far as furniture goes, I am more in the market for the inspiration old furniture has to offer than actually wanting to own it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If I see a piece that interests me the store owners are usually happy to let me take photos and measurements (always ask permission first!). All in all we rarely buy much on these trips, just the occasional interesting trinket or old saw.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

            <title>Howarth&apos;s &quot;Sheffield Pad&quot; Brace by Jim Hendricks</title>
            <description>James Howarth is one of my favorite names amongst the Sheffield edge tool businesses. His irons are commonly found in 19th century planes, yet he was far more than that. He produced many tools in the mid 1800s and this beautiful &quot;Sheffield Pad&quot; brace is testament to that.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Listed as &quot;edge tool maker, engraver, die sinkers&apos; tool and cast steel auger maker, saw file and hammer maker&quot; the company was liquidated in 1912.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Hollow Auger by James E. Price</title>
            <description>I just got home from the post office with this tool from Martin Donnelly.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When I saw a photo of it on eBay I knew it belonged in my collection because I have collected hollow augers for well over 50 years and have never seen one made from a rabbet plane.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It has a handforged three-post tang so it could be rotated with a brace and a rabbet plane bolted to a block of wood with a hole in it. I will give this wonderfully ingenious tool a gentle cleaning, hone the blade, and determine how well it works.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

            <title>Thomas Moodey - 18th Century Plough Plane by Richard Arnold</title>
            <description>Collecting 18th century ploughs is something of a passion of mine and this is the first example I ever found.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The plane is marked Moodey, and is almost certainly by Thomas Moodey of Birmingham. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It is now thought that the earlier planes marked Moodey, Worcester, were by his father.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
However, judging from the wedge shape of this example I would put it at around 1760, which would make it likely to be by Thomas.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

            <title>This is a Stick Up! by Jim Hendricks</title>
            <description>A few tools are considered uniquely British but few are more deserving of this definition than the old &quot;pig sticker&quot; mortise chisel.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Still made in England today, this design hasn&apos;t changed much in more than two centuries, proof if it were needed that it was perfect to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The strength of this style of mortise chisel is pretty obvious - brute force and virtual indestructibility.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Sharpened up with a flat or even slightly convex bevel, these chisel can be pounded to cut and levered hard to remove waste.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

            <title>Building a Kerfing Plane by Kat Beers-McCormick</title>
            <description>I am a woodworker who works 100% without power tools. I needed to make a tool to re-saw thick boards into thinner boards and to make my own banding and veneers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Tom Fidgen’s kerfing plane was the tool I needed to build. I used the design in Tom’s book, The Unplugged Woodshop, for the plane and added a moveable bridle fence of my own design.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

            <title>1840’s Plow Plane Tune Up by Jason Stamper</title>
            <description>I have had this little 1840’s plow plane for a few years now and it has been a great tool.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A while back I did a whole write up on it that you can see here. This has been a dandy little plane and performed very well over the few years I’ve owned it. However, lately I’ve noticed that if I am cutting a deeper groove a problem arises.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What happens is that the plane begins to bind up, as it gets deeper into the cut. I thought about the problem for a while and finally came up with the solution. The answer is actually quite simple, and one a craftsman of old would have easily understood.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

            <title>English Joiners&apos; Mallet by James E. Price</title>
            <description>I have heard quite a few discussions concerning mallets but I have seen no reference to fine English joiners&apos; mallets.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I guess it is up to me to discuss one. I have used this particular mallet for several years and find it to be just the right one for tapping mortise and tenons together. It weighs about two pounds and behaves for me much like a deadblow mallet, you know, the orange plastic ones with the oil and lead shot in them. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I use it only for assembly of joints and find it ill suited for striking chisels. The way the handle holds the two lignum vitae inserts into the heavy gunmetal casting is intriguing. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

            <description>The trouble with wandering into the mysterious world of real woodworking, aka - making furniture, is that you need a whole bunch of new gizmos to do it properly!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The benefit of being an amateur woodworker i.e. a toolmaker is that you can make these gizmos!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Apparently, to make cabinets you need winding sticks. I often see people peering at them and go &quot;umph&quot; and then whittling a bit more stock off a board!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So I went in search of old Georgian ones. There are two things wrong with this plan. Firstly, most are warped but more importantly, they are so rare that you have to remortgage the house to buy them!&lt;br /&gt;</description>

            <title>18th Century British Button Pad Stock Braces by Richard Arnold</title>
            <description>At a recent East Midlands TATHS meeting we had a discussion about early braces.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The first button pads to appear were made of iron rather than the usual brass examples commonly seen right through the 19th century.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The middle example is marked &quot;Freeth&quot; There are two possible candidates that may have been the maker. Firstly, Benjamin Freeth of Birmingham who is listed in 1770 as being a gimlet and auger maker, or from the same 1770 directory, Samuel and Samson Freeth, Edge tool makers, and factors.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

            <title>Robert Towell Mitre-The Good..The Bad.. and The Ugly - P. 1 by Jim Hendricks</title>
            <description>One great thing about handling loads of infill planes is that you get to recognize quality, even when it&apos;s heavily disguised.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I was busy working on e-BORE in the back room today when ALFIE! came rushing in telling me the man from Royal Mail Parcels was at the door! This was really helpful because I didn&apos;t hear the knock and he had a very special package for me.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This ugly brute was one such example on eBay UK. Starting at a low price, the auction strangely timed to end at 8am on a Monday and nobody else seemed bothered so I was the only bidder.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

            <title>17th century Cooper&apos;s Plane by Jim Hendricks</title>
            <description>I mentioned this cooper&apos;s plane before but could not find anything about it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
David Russell collection to the rescue, as is often the case...&lt;br /&gt;
Caption from Russell&apos;s fine book &quot;Antique Woodworking Tools&quot; shows and explains it clearly.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And here is my plane... exactly the same. Definitely oak... Holm oak... have to look that up!</description>

            <title>Stan Shaw, a Sheffield Pocket-knife Maker by Geoffrey Tweedale</title>
            <description>In early December 2016, I dropped in on an old friend – Stan Shaw – at Kelham Island Industrial Museum in Sheffield.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I’ve known him for about 30 years, which is about the span of his career as an independent pocket-knife maker. However, his working life as a cutler goes back much further than that, as a premier craftsman at some of Sheffield’s leading firms. He began in the trade 75 years ago and has been making high-quality knives ever since.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

            <title>An Interesting Electrical Power Plant - The Iron Age, Vol.55, June 13, 1895, (New York: David Williams, Publisher and Proprietor).</title>
            <description>The Simonds Mfg. Company of Fitchburg, Mass., were among the first of the manufacturers in New England to realize the immense advantages to be derived from the electrical distribution of power, particularly where water power, otherwise unavailable, could be utilized to furnish the initial energy.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Wanoosnoc Brook, which has a flow of about 2000 cubic feet per minute, and which has a rapid descent through a gorge some 3 miles from the city of Fitchburg, furnished to the Simonds Company a ready means of substituting water power for that of steam in their works.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

            <title>Multitool for Bit Braces by James E. Price</title>
            <description>It is one of the rarest tools that can be affixed in the chuck of a brace.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Today I share a bitstock tool from my collection. Once affixed in a brace the user has a choice of six tools that can be deployed forward and used. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Choices are a center bit, a quill bit, a turnscrew bit, a square reamer, a countersink bit, and a spoon bit. A patent is associated with this cluster of bitstock tools. It was issued to Alexander and John Clarke on March 18, 1890 and assigned Patent Number 423,513. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

            <title>18th Century Dovetail Saw, Unknown Maker by Mari Subritzky</title>
            <description>My friend, Mari Subritzky from Melbourne, AU, send me pictures and short description on a saw she recently found. She writes:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;I suspect that it could be a very early saw, so I&apos;m very interested to hear others&apos; views on the age or possible origin of the saw. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It&apos;s 8&quot; long, a tapered brass back that is very rounded on the top, the tiny handle is only 5/8&quot; thick, the saw plate is 15thou thick, 13.5ppi &amp; a rip profile. What I find attractive about this saw is the double horn cut outs at the top &amp; bottom of the handle, I&apos;ve seen a few early saws but I haven&apos;t seen that shape on a handle before. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

            <title>Breaking the Mould - Building Unconventional Try Plane, Inspired by Three Centuries of British Plane Making by Richard Arnold</title>
            <description>The classic 22” beech try plane has not altered in form much since the middle of the 18th century. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Having recently finished making a version of an early 18th century jack plane, I decided it might be nice to make a try plane to partner it. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Rather than sticking to the tried and tested formula I have set out to address some of the issues I had with the design, and drawing inspiration from a number of planes in my own collection, endeavored to come up with a fresh approach to this planes build. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

            <title>Repair of a Complex, Standing Fillister by Jim Hendricks</title>
            <description>I love planes by the &quot;MOONS&quot; as their workshop was around the corner from where I first worked... also many moons ago!!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This beautifully plane was made by by Thos. or John Moon sometime during 1795 - 1828 time period. Their shop was located at 145 St. Martins Lane, London.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The plane has a skewed iron and wedged nicker along with a screwed brass depth stop. The feature that really attracted me to this example was the &quot;boxing&quot;. In this case it isn&apos;t just boxwood. Ebony is also added to a fillet on the corner. Unfortunately, the whole rear section of ebony was missing.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

            <title>Box for Two English Smoothers by James E. Price</title>
            <description>If you have followed my posts you have seen photos of several cases I have made to protect fine tools  both on my shop shelf and for transport my woodworking demonstrations at National Park Service cultural events. Most of the cases I have made hold a single tool or an assortment of small related tools.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Yesterday I decided to containerize two handmade English smoothers that I frequently use. Thoughts of design have been in my head for months. Through careful planning I was able to fit the two smoothers into a case only 10 inches by 10 inches.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

            <title>Remarkable Record of William H. Hart of the Stanley Works, New Britain, Conn.</title>
            <description>Having for sixty consecutive years been honored with election to an executive office of the Stanley Works in New Britain and a good share of that time holding two important such capacities at once, William H. Hart, eighty years old, resigned as president on February 16 at the annual meeting of the stockholders.&lt;br /&gt;
He accepted a newly created office of chairman of the board of directors.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
George P. Hart, son of William H. Hart, was elected to fill the presidency made vacant by his father’s resignation.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
E. Allen Moore, his son-in law, was made vice-president. Another son of Chairman Hart, Walter H. Hart, was elected to the newly created position of assistant secretary.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

            <title>The Making of the Cast Iron Carpenters’ Plane at the Stanley Rule &amp; Level Company - The Iron Age, Vol. 62</title>
            <description>Few in the trade, and perhaps none out of it, appreciate fully the time, care, skill and peculiar refinement displayed in the manufacture of the highest grade iron body carpenters’ plane.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A mere statement of the steps essential to the production of this tool would be a revelation to 99 per cent of those who handled it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A book would be required to describe fully all the processes through which the raw materials pass. A lump of cast iron and a plate of steel are united in a product which is absolutely reliable and absolutely accurate in every way.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

            <title>Unusual 18th Century Rebate Plane by Richard Arnold</title>
            <description>When the 3rd addition of British Plane Makers was published the maker of this unusual plane was still something of a mystery.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
S. Tomkinson mark was presumed to be from the Birmingham area due to the unusual form of the stamp, but we now know that the true identity of this maker is Samuel Tomkinson of London.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

            <description>I recently won a mystery 18th century bead moulding plane on eBay UK for a tenner.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Wheeler&apos;s Patented Countersink by James E. Price</title>
            <description>Following my last post on the D. F. Barber countersink, Michael Dulong commented he has a Wheeler&apos;s Patent countersink with an 1870 patent date imprinted on it. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This post provides more detail on Wheeler&apos;s Patent countersinks. It is not hard to find this countersink. The hard part is finding the depth gauge that attaches to it. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Asa Wheeler of Battleborough patented the countersink on April 12, 1870 and it was issued Patent number 101,796. The following year, 1871, Wheeler patented the depth gauge for his countersink. It was issued Patent Number 116,901, issued on July 11, 1871. The first photo shows representative specimens I pulled from my collection.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

            <title>Barber&apos;s Ingenious Countersink by James E. Price</title>
            <description>One of the rarest and most ingenious countersinks was patented on August 3, 1880 by Daniel F. Barber.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It is a transformer tool and is the only tool I am aware of that not only cuts a countersink but also serves as a dowel pointer. Look and the photos and I think you will agree that Barber was a mechanical genius.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 And, by the way, he is the same mechanical genius who patented the shell chuck that is on 95% of the braces you find.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

            <title>Rebuilding Gabriel Moving Fillister, part 2 by Jim Jim Hendricks</title>
            <description>I whittled some English boxwood down to start making the replacement depth stop but overnight I decided to use beech instead.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Chatting with Ollie Sparks and Richard Arnold about the form it should take and they suggested a few examples. One was very close and I decided to do a good prototype to see if it will work.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The second thought I had was that an English boxwood depth stop, though nice, would be non-stock and may look just wrong. So... here is the process for making one in beech.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

            <title>Rebuilding Gabriel Moving Fillister, part 1 by Jim Jim Hendricks</title>
            <description>At the David Stanley auction on Saturday, a friend of mine Richard Arnold and Andy Brown aka Andy &quot;Tools &apos;n Tat&quot; presented me with a rather sorry plane.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He said: &quot;This is for you Jim, a present... firstly because it&apos;s a Gabriel and I know you love Gabriels but mostly because I know you&apos;d love to bring it back to life!&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Yah RIGHT!! Andy!!I&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I will be doing this slowly and document each part in case there are any other eegits out there tempted to do the same!&lt;br /&gt;</description>

            <title>English Corner or Miter Clamps, Part 2 by James E. Price</title>
            <description>Thanks for all the interest in the Preston corner or miter clamp which was the subject of my previous article.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I was inspired to show you similar English corner clamps that I have used several years.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Unlike American corner clamps that have two threaded shafts that exert force at 90 degrees one to the other, English clamps have but one screw that approaches the corner at a right angle. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I have selected clamps that illustrate the range in sizes and the way force is exerted on the wooden workpieces. All of these clamps work well and are very robust. Now that you know what an English corner clamp looks like, you can be on the lookout for one.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

            <title>Early Tenon Saw - Iron Back, 14-5/8 inch long, 13 PPI, Closed Handle, Crosscut profile by Tony Waldis</title>
            <description>This is an iron back tenon saw by Beardshaw and Son which shows signs of having been shortened from the toe.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The blade is 14 and 5/8 inches long with a depth at the toe of 3 and 1/4 inches and at the heel of 3 and 3/8 inches. The average thickness of the blade is 0.030 inch. The teeth are 10 PPI crosscut profile with a rake of about 15 degrees and fleam of 15 degrees.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The closed London Pattern handle is fixed by three iron rivets, one of which seems to have had a brass washer added as a repair. It is not clear whether the rivets are original but the holes look to be angle countersunk rather than having been drilled for split nuts and screws.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

            <title>English Corner or Miter Clamps by James E. Price</title>
            <description>For those of you who are not familiar with what English corner or miter clamps look like, this post is for you.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We are all familiar with the ubiquitous Craftsmen corner clamps that can be found in yard sales here in the U.S. They are not the greatest quality and are often found broken or with the slide bars bent.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Over the years I have fallen in love with English corner clamps which are quite different and perform extremely well. Yesterday at a tool show I purchased a Preston corner clamp to add to my clamps.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

            <title>Building a Complex Moulding Plane, part 1 by Amy H. McAuley</title>
            <description>When I first started building planes I really had no idea what I was doing.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In my mind the most logical place to start with it was to look at the types of planes I needed to build for my work.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The planes that I use most often are sprung sash planes. These are side escapement types that run at an angle instead of vertically.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So when I built my first plane I used the only sprung sash plane I owned as my template and made all the angles to match. The plane worked and functioned as I had wanted. I consulted with a couple of books, namely John Whelan’s book Making Traditional Wooden Planes and felt pretty comfortable building this one type of plane after half a dozen or so.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

            <title>J. Taylor &amp; Son - Patented Combination Saw, 24 inch.</title>
            <description>In early 1870s Taylor Brothers announced several new features for various types of saws, including &quot;long&quot; crosscut saws, circular saws and hand saws. One of these designs was a Patented Combination Saw.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The idea of a Combination Saw was not new. It was originally designed and patented in United States by Jackson Gorham in 1856 (patent No. 14,863) and improved by Hiram Smith in 1858 (patent no. 20,313). Both patents were assigned to Henry Disston and saws based on these patents were produced for many years.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
However, the design was never patented in United Kingdom and saws were never produced by English sawmakers until Taylor Brothers took on the task.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

            <title>Design of an Early 18th Century Jack Plane by Richard Arnold</title>
            <description>For a number of years now I have been playing around with the design of an early 18th century jack plane. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I have drawn inspiration from the planes illustrated on the John Jennion trade card as these are the only clue as to what form they may have taken. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This is because as yet no one has managed to find an original example. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

            <title>My Various Shoot Boards by James E. Price</title>
            <description>I wanted to show you some other shoot boards I use in my work. I have used shooting boards since the mid-1970&apos;s, particularly in making small boxes. I have one long shooting board for full-sized miter planes and two smaller scale ones. The big one is 36 inches in length and made of willow oak. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This is the shooting board setup that I most frequently use. It will allow the shooting of both 90&apos;s and right and left 45&apos;s. In order to shoot a left 45 on moldings I have to use a plane other than the one in the photo.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

            <title>New Bench for Saw Sharpening and more, part 2 by Mike Hagemyer</title>
            <description>Here are the vise components all cleaned up and painted. I have also got the bench top nearly done. The vise housing is pocketed into the top and fastened. In order to not compromise the main purpose for this bench, I decided to stick with my original thinking and put the vise in the middle.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The work will be centered at the front with all my sharpening tools behind, in easy reach. I still need to build a lower shelf and the tool tray but first I will finish up the vise and add an apron to the front of the bench top. With that done I will be able to actually use the bench and vise to help make the rest of the components.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

            <title>Tooling Up for Next Project by Amy Harrington McAuley</title>
            <description>One of my big yearlong projects this year is the restoration of North Head Lighthouse in Cape Disappointment State Park, Ilwaco WA.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The lighthouse was constructed in 1897. Carl Leick was the architect of this lighthouse along with 24 other structures in the Northwest. As the mouth of the Columbia River is treacherous in the best of weather, mariners where complaining that the earlier built light at the mouth was insufficient for ships coming out of the North.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The following 2 pictures are of the lighthouse in its current state. The restoration currently underway is a multi-phased project that will go on for a couple of years.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

            <title>Recreating a Robert Wooding&apos;s Panel Raiser by Richard Arnold</title>
            <description>Collecting old tools is something I’m sure we all enjoy, but for myself, I’m always fascinated by how they may have been used, and also how well they performed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Many old tools can be restored and be used, but sometimes they are ether to badly damaged, or of such historical importance that it would be inappropriate to use them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This panel plane by Robert Wooding is a good example. It is a very early specimen of this maker&apos;s work. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

            <title>Christopher Gabriel - London, GB:  Sash Saw - Brass Back, 13.75 inch long, 9 PPI by Rob Brophy</title>
            <description>The first saw with GABRIEL stamp mark ever reported was found in Canada a decade or so ago by Rob Brophy.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now we can see this saw that came from the business of Christopher Gabriel, a plane maker and dealer in carpenters’ tools, 1770-1822, London, GB.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Christopher Gabriel and his business became well known through the research of William Goodman and subsequent publication of a book by Jane and Mark Rees, “Christopher Gabriel and the Tool Trade in 18th Century London.” It is also well known that the saws in Seaton chest came from the shop of Christopher Gabriel.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

            <title>The First Iron Casting in America by Albert Spies, Cassier&apos;s Magazine, 1894</title>
            <description>Among the riches of mineral wealth and the products of the metallurgical arts in the Mining Building at the World’s Columbian Exposition, in Chicago [1893], there was not anything which attracted more serious interest on the part of those acquainted with the founding of metals, than a modest glass case in the gallery of the building, containing a tiny iron kettle, of about one quart capacity, swinging on a miniature crane. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The cause of this attraction was not due to any peculiarity of design or material, or skill in workmanship, but to the fact that the kettle was well authenticated as the first casting made in America and the precursor of the vast iron industry of the country.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The kettle was cast at the Saugus Iron Works at Lynn, Mass., in 1642, probably in the autumn, and was given to Thomas Hudson, as the consideration for sixty acres of land, comprising a portion of the iron works property.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Spear &amp; Jackson’s Improved Pattern Silver Steel Handsaw - Work magazine, 1889</title>
            <description>This excellent saw, described in Messrs. Spear &amp; Jackson&apos;s price list as No. 1887 - a number which, perhaps, it will be well to quote in giving orders – is in every respect a nice tool to look at and a capital tool to handle and work with.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
An old professional to whom I showed it, one of the best handreilers in the United Kingdom, fairly smiled with pleasure as he took the specimen saw sent to me into his hands, and examined it from handle to point with the utmost interest.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;Yes, that&apos;s something like a saw,&quot; he said, as he handed it back to me with a lingering touch, and then asked the price, us though he would have liked to have made it his own.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

            <title>Henry Brown - Birmingham, GB: Reeding Plane by Jim Hendricks</title>
            <description>It would seem that even back in Georgian times there was snobbery. Henry opened his workshop in 1797 in Fazey St. Birmingham in the Midlands of England - the &quot;provinces&quot; as they were known.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So why then is this gorgeous reeding plane marked &quot;LONDON&quot;? Goodman in BPM3 suggests that they may have been for export, as one such plane was found in Australia.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Personally, I reckon he was just a snob and it was far more prestigious to say they were made in London, as provincial plane making was very much in its infancy, with only seven commercial makers in the city compared with over twenty in the capital.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

            <title>Tool Blocks for Storage by James E. Price</title>
            <description>t seems like I have lots of little specialty tools that I often reach for and in order to keep them organized and within easy reach, I keep them in tool blocks mounted on my shop wall. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The design of my tool blocks did not come from me but from a primitive lamp or candle shelf on the wall of an old log cabin here in the Missouri Ozarks. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

            <description>It is very rare occasion to see a saw from early 19th century. It is even bigger surprise to see a saw that came from the business of Christopher Gabriel, a plane maker and dealer in carpenters’ tools, 1770-1822, London, GB. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Christopher Gabriel and his business became well known through the research of William Goodman and subsequent publication of a book by Jane and Mark Rees, “Christopher Gabriel and the Tool Trade in 18th Century London.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
According to sources, C. Gabriel did not make saws in his business. As a dealer, he purchased saws and other metal tools from outside suppliers and marked them with his name. This saw is one of only two known examples marked by C. Gabriel. WK&lt;br /&gt;</description>

            <title>Boxing Mr. Cox, part 2 by Jim Hendricks</title>
            <description>In this second part of my article on the replacement of old worn boxing on an 18th Century 1/2&quot; bead moulding plane, I shall be showing how the boxing slices are refined to match the old profile.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But first we need to make a scratch stock. Let&apos;s do it ...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
First, I found a piece of spring steel... in this case an old and blunt disposable Japanese saw blade. Never throw old blades away... they make excellent scratch blades and cabinet scrapers!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I &quot;blued&quot; it with spray engineer&apos;s &quot;blue&quot;, but a permanent marker works just as well...&lt;br /&gt;</description>

            <title>Boxing Mr. Cox, part 1 by Jim Hendricks</title>
            <description>Some weeks ago Douglas Claytor showed me a half inch bead moulding plane by John Cox, Deritend, Birmingham, 1770-1843.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Clearly, this plane has been making beads since then, judging by the astounding boxing wear! The front has worn all the way down to the profile base and this will render it very difficult to engage at the start of the cut.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

            <title>How To Sharpen a Router Plane Blade by Jim Harvey</title>
            <description>I have a couple of Stanley 71 router planes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The cutters are difficult to sharpen because the bevel is blocked by the shaft that connects the foot with the plane.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Last weekend, at a Midwest Tool Collectors show, I acquired a Stanley 271 which is similar to the 71 but only about a third of the size.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

            <description>Here is a recent junk store find that I hope will restore to a usable tool.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It is for sure a bit rusty right now but it has a nice shape with plenty of blade left. In this state it looks unmarked and old. It is obviously hand forged with no frills. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The handle tangs are squared and tapered. They extend through the handle caps and are peened neatly over the thin metal caps. The handles are a little loose but still in fairly good shape.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

            <title>Two Small Planes by James E. Price</title>
            <description>These photos show two planes I made at the same time I made the planes in my last post.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The top one is actually a little jointer plane that I use to make perfect edges on little boards for tool cases. I find that it works for me better than a Stanley block plane which is much bigger.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

            <title>Atkins Silver Steel Saws - Saw Sense - E. C. Atkins &amp; Co., Inc., ca. 1930</title>
            <description>THE SAW - The Most Important Tool in the Carpenter’s Kit&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In order to do the best work with the least exertion, your saw must be made of the proper material and scientifically constructed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Atkins Silver Steel Saws have marked an epoch in the history of the saw. They are not only made of the very best material, but are constructed on new, exclusive scientific principles which are instantly appreciated by the buyer of the tools.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

            <title>Handbook on Saws - Henry Disston &amp; Sons, Inc., 1912</title>
            <description>This is downloadable catalog from 1912.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The numerous requests for information, particularly concerning Handsaws, various Tools and Files, etc., from those not interested in the larger Saws, Band and Circular, and Tools for the Saw Mill, led us to publish this portion of our regular Handbook.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The articles describing the making of the goods are essentially short, for to cite each individual operation would require many pages. Only the most important processes, therefore, are referred to; though, of course, the numerous intermediate steps also have an important bearing on the workmanship and efficiency of the finished tool.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Scythe Making at Abbeydale by Geoffrey Tweedale</title>
            <description>If one wants to discover the roots of Sheffield’s tool industry, then – paradoxically – it is best to ignore inner city Sheffield and instead head for the countryside.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Around Sheffield is some of the country’s most beautiful scenery: a hilly and wooded landscape, riven by numerous streams and dotted with picturesque old buildings.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It seems distant from any industrial past, yet this was where Sheffield’s tool (and cutlery) industry began. The hills and valleys are riddled with scores of weirs, dams, and forges – witness to an era when water wheels for grinding lined the river banks. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In the 19th century, they made Sheffield the most important scythe and sickle making region in the country (indeed in the world).&lt;br /&gt;</description>

            <description>Hand Saws for All Uses&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Spear &amp; Jackson are always seeking means to improve their Saws, and their latest innovation in the process of Saw manufacture is the special tempering now applied to all Spear &amp; Jackson&apos;s high grade Saws.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This new process of tempering enables them to guarantee that all Saws so treated are uniform in temper and possess greater wear-resisting properties than any other make.

We know of instances where our Saws are still doing as good work as ever for the grandsons of the original purchasers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It should always be remembered that the Saws bearing Spear &amp; Jackson&apos;s well-known trademarks are made from the firm&apos;s own special Saw Steel, and that each and every stage in the manufacture is carried out by the firm in its own workshops.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

            <title>Early 1850s Backsaw with Triple-Cove Handle by H. Disston</title>
            <description>Majority of saws with triple-cove handle found today are known as an early creations of Henry Disston.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Most were manufactured in late 1840&apos;s and early 1850s. This particular saw is even more valuable to collectors. It has a double-eagle stamp on the spine.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
These saws are rather rare and not many have survived. They always dictate high prices. This particular saw was sold on eBay.com in July 2016 for $551.15.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Lignum Vitae Planes by James E. Price</title>
            <description>Recently I purchased a Lignum vitae handled smooth plane to use with two others I had found a decade apart.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I have never understood why such quality planes do not demand a high price on the old tool market. A month ago I paid $10.00 for the handled smoother at auction with about 60 tool dealers and collectors present. I paid less than that for each of the other ones.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Straightening bent, kinked and bowed handsaws by Mike Hagemyer</title>
            <description>In the course of recovering old handsaws I have run onto many that have suffered bending damage of different degrees  and some that I should have avoided but didn’t. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Today I will usually walk away from a saw that is badly bent up unless the price is awful low or the saw is special. However, I have to admit, for me it’s difficult to pass up some saws no matter what.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Tusk Tenons… How Strong Are They? by Will Myers</title>
            <description>One of the questions most often asked about the Moravian workbench I wrote about a few years back, concerns the tusk tenons (aka keyed tenons) that are the backbone of the design.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The tusk tenons on the bench I built over four years ago have performed flawlessly. That bench is still the one I use primarily, it travels with me to classes and on other trips, assembled and taken apart scores of times.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Nevertheless, the keyed tenon seem to have a not so great reputation in the woodworking community. I think that this bad reputation comes not so much from the older forms of the joint, but from later times, more specifically arts and crafts furniture.</description>

            <title>Mathieson Shoulder Plane by James E. Price</title>
            <description>I recently attended a Great Planes Trading Company Auction in St. Peter&apos;s, Missouri and purchased the only two infill planes in the sale which included at least 400 planes. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The photos are of an Alex Mathieson shoulder plane that was advertised as being in new condition. I totally agree with that catalog description. It appears to have never been honed and used and has the finest throat have ever seen on any shoulder plane. &lt;br /&gt;

            <description>Having tuned the iron pocket, bed, and wedge I now had to cut a sliding dovetail for the handle. I am terrified... yes I sure am.&lt;br /&gt;

One slip now and a week and a lot of money down the tubes. A test dovetail was made using a test handle in apple. The only problem...I had no dimensioned apple... only a log!&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>The Controlled Split by Mike Hagemyer</title>
            <description>Recently a friend was clearing a fence line on his farm and asked if I could use some fire wood.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
No, I answered but what kind of wood would it be? Red oak was the reply. Is it clean wood or dead branches, I asked?
He stated the tree had been hit by lightning but there was a pretty good size trunk.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Stanley 146 Match Plane by James E. Price</title>
            <description>I have looked for quite some time for a 3/8th-inch Stanley 146 match plane at a reasonable price I have looked for quite some time for a 3/8th-inch Stanley 146 match plane at a reasonable price and one came my way recently at The Great Planes Trading Company antique tool auction in St. Peter&apos;s, Missouri.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I will probably do some match work with it but what I really wanted it for is for making sliding lids for small tool boxes. I figured out that I could use the grooving function on both margins of a lid and then plane one fin of the groove away to create the projections. &lt;br /&gt;

            <description>Having discovered a good source of this fine rare wood, I decided to make a series of woodies.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I had thought to make a wedge-mouth mitre but in discussions with Ollie Sparks we both think this species too brittle to cope with a 20° bed... the rear mouth will almost certainly chip out.&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>In 1900 The Simonds Mfg. Co. presents hand saws for the first time at the International Universal Exposition in Paris.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In December of 1900 the company began operation of crucible steel plant in Chicago, adjacent to the long saws factory built in 1892.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Fitchburg factory was enlarged with addition dedicated to hand saws manufacturing.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Kerfing &quot;Plane&quot; MK.1, part 2 by Jim Hendricks</title>
            <description>Cutting the blade slot, fitting the saw nuts and blade and testing.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In order to cut the correct kerf I used a thin kerf Japanese saw, a replacement blade for this saw being used in the kerfing saw.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 used saw nuts from Workshop Heaven to clamp the blade in the slot. Once done, I attached a temporary fence using a small cramp. The results were perfect!&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Kerfing &quot;Plane&quot; MK.1, part 1 by Jim Hendricks</title>
            <description>I mentioned how handy it would be to have a kerfing plane (saw) ala Tom Fidgen and I really wanted to use it solely for cutting veneers, so the fixed fence one would be good.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But I want to play with fences, brass rods, turning wheels, and ebony and boxwood. Doing this one first allows it to be a prototype for the handles, testing of the Japanese blade and generally practicing.</description>

            <title>Cumberland Gap National Park Event, Part 3 by James E. Price</title>
            <description>We were busy in The Heritage Shop at Ozark Scenic Riverways with my students making boxes for tools and supplies out of rived red oak boards.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The boxes are based on one I made a year ago with very primitive tools. They are laced together at the corners with leather or artificial sinew.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Today I got way down the road on making a box with a partition in the middle. Square nails of two sizes will be stored in this box and they will be used in the construction of wooden coffins.</description>

            <title>Saw Tooth Shaping and Sharpening Process by Mike Hagemyer</title>
            <description>Rather than trying to steer you through the structured monotony of learning the process I think it will be more fun for you and me to document a few complete restorations. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
By the time I am done you will have experienced all the basics and more. I will try and reduce the strain by using many pictures and a little less preaching.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Cumberland Gap National Park Event, Part 2 by James E. Price</title>
            <description>This post is a continuation of the one I did on making a leather strop (The Cumberland Gap) for putting that final polished edge on chisels, plane irons, drawknives, spokeshaves, and even axes. I made this one for a coffin making toolkit I will be using in a National Park Service demonstration at Cumberland Gap.</description>

            <title>Understanding Handsaw Geometry and Terms by Mike Hagemyer</title>
            <description>Though much has been written on this subject I feel there is room for more.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
At the risk of redundancy hopefully I can clear some of the confusion. Also when I speak of certain features I want you to be able to come back here for reference when required.  For clarity I will use specific names for certain features plus pictures and sketches that identify them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Saw tooth geometry involves three major angles that must be understood; rake, fleam and slope.</description>

            <title>Beardshaw &amp; Son Brass Back Tenon Saw - 12 inch long &amp; 12 PPI rip profile with 5 degrees of rake.</title>
            <description>The Beardshaw &amp; Son was one of the largest and long-lived company involved in production of various edge tools, including saws. They were early exporters of saws to US and Canada and many of these saws can still be found on American continent.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The medallion on this saw suggest that it was made specifically for export to US. However, the seller of this saw is my friend, Mari Subritzky from Melbourne, and it is a mystery how this saw landed in Australia. But than, Mari has many tools with mysterious history and you can see them on eBay.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This is an early tenon saw that I especially like.</description>

            <title>Handsaw Rescue by Mike Hagemyer</title>
            <description>Did I ever mention how much I hate aspiring artists who think they are being original by painting on a saw plate? &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now this doesn’t bother me quite so much if it is just a rusty old no name saw. However, it’s all too often that I run into a really nice century or so old Disston that could easily be put back to work. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This is the story of one such saw I recently rescued. That’s right; I hate painted saws so much that I usually buy them just so I can destroy the so called art. Truthfully, I only buy them if I want the saw.</description>

            <title>Making Tapered Octagonal Tool Handles the Traditional Way by James E. Price</title>
            <description>In about a month and a half I will be doing a frontier coffin making demonstration at Cumberland Gap National Park and will be using original tools that were in use at the time Daniel Boone and others guided thousands of settlers westward through The Gap.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The target dates are circa 1785-1815. I have some 18th Century chisels with original handles but I do not want to use them so I am putting handles on some that are not quite so historically significant.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I selected a William Butcher chisel and will make a tapered octagonal handle for it. It is a decade or two later than 1815 but will look enough like an earlier chisel that it will pass as one. I selected a piece of dense dogwood for the new handle. It is so dense that it almost looks like boxwood.</description>

            <title>Small Layout Tools by James E. Price</title>
            <description>I make lots of small things and small layout tools are necessary.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I soon found out that big slitting gauges, panel marking gauges, and squares just wouldn&apos;t work so I made some miniature tools which have worked well for me. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The first photo shows three of the tools I made and have used for about 20 years. There is a nickel in the photo for scale.</description>

            <title>Boring Hole With Fire by James E. Price</title>
            <description>For eons mankind has made holes through wood with burning awls or augers. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I seldom see any current woodworkers using this method to make perfectly round or square holes in wooden workpieces. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When I was but a youngster burning augers were common here in the Missouri Ozarks and were often used by blacksmith&apos;s to make bolt holes in wooden wagon parts. But their use was not limited to smiths because I remember a man named Punk Murray sitting by a small fire in his yard burning holes in wood with a burning awl.</description>

            <description>You are most likely thinking that this time I am going too far with a guy who designed printers. 
But there is another side of Robert Hoe and his enterprise. He became one of the most important sawmaker in late 1820s and 1830s. His shop produced circular saws from cast steel provided by Sanderson Brothers, Sheffield. There are a few examples of hand saws made by Hoe as well, but this was only very small part of his saw production.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I will show a sample of his dovetail saw at the end of the article.</description>

            <title>Taylor Brothers German Steel 26&quot; rip saw by Mari Subritzky</title>
            <description>I thought that I would share a recent find with you. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A Taylor Brothers 26&quot; rip saw, stamped with &quot;German Steel&quot; &amp; Taylor Brothers in the center of the blade. Toward the handle it has the serpentine &quot;Made for Use&quot; stamp.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The unusual thing on this saw is that it has a secondary die stamp on the reverse back side of the blade just off center, &quot;Blyth Brothers Sole Importers&quot;. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This saw was found in Melbourne Australia, it&apos;s a curious thing, sole importers to Melbourne, or some OTHER place... ?</description>

            <title>At the Sign of the Three Plains by Jim Hendricka</title>
            <description>From the first day I opened the wonderful book by Bill Goodman: “British Planemakers from 1700” at the first page, I was struck by the trade card of JOHN JENNION, 1732-57. The wonderful “cartouche” depicting the tools they sold started me on a long and interesting journey of discovery of the fine British wooden plane the tool that built an Empire!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In this, the first of a series of articles about key players in the making of these historical gems, I shall start at the beginning. Well, it’s the beginning for now, but discoveries are always coming to light, .pushing back the boundaries of time before 1700 and it excites me to think of what is yet to be discovered.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I intend to follow the history of each maker, in detail where I have an example of their wares and in passing when I don’t. There are a number of roots to famous makers and this one starts, not with John Jennion at all but a few steps further back with his master, Robert Wooding and his master before him Thomas Granford.</description>

            <title>Patent Bracket-saw Frame by Henry L. Pratt</title>
            <description>In 1878 catalog Millers Falls offered two Patented Bracket Saw Frames. One was made in wood and was offered in two varieties; Rosewood and Birch. Wood was highly polished.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The frames were produced in two sizes of frame clearance: 12 and 14 inches. The prices varied and depended of wood used for construction. Rosewood frame was more expensive, at $15.00 per dozen. The birch frame was a little cheaper - at $12.00 per dozen.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The frames were produced up to 1903 and appear in the Millers Falls Catalog &quot;B&quot;, 1903.</description>

            <title>The Early Manufacture of Saws in this Country - Iron Age, 1890</title>
            <description>There are probably but one or two men now living who are familiar with the history of the manufacture of Saws in this country. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
One of these is Emanuel Andrews, of E. Andrews &amp; Son, Williamsport, Pa., who has in his possession the first Sawmaker‘s anvil brought to America. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It has been used and owned by an Andrews for more than 80 years, and was brought from London by William Andrews, an uncle of the present owner, in 1819.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Emanuel Andrews came to this country with his father, Benjamin Andrews in 1833, and located in New York City, where he conducted a shop for repairing saws.</description>

            <title>HENRY DISSTON, PHILADA , 1840s Handsaw</title>
            <description>This saw appeared on eBay in January, 2015. Unfortunately, I didn&apos;t make a note on sale price but I know it was high and beyond my pay grade.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Medallion is the obvious item that pops in everybody&apos;s eye right away. I have never seen medallion like this, neither anybody I know in this business.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The handle is also one of a kind and I am tempted to say that this is one of these handles made by hand in his shop.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The blade is 26-1/2 inch long. Nib is present and it looks like it has been hand-filed. The teeth are filed crosscut with rather shallow set.</description>

Today I received what I believe to be my oldest example. Yes, another patient in need of some repair to the wedge but basically sound and deeply patinated.</description>

            <title>The Making of a Ball Bearing Ratchet Bit Brace - Iron Age, 1899</title>
            <description>The ordinary bit brace of the carpenter consisted principally of a rod bent so as to form a crank provided with a rest at one end and a socket at the other end for the reception of the tool, and it might be a handle on the crank.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In these early tools little or no attempt was made toward refining the implement. It was a rough device intended for rough work, and both in its manufacture and in its employment nothing was expected in the way of accuracy or finish. If it would hold the tools and possessed sufficient strength for the work in hand, no more was expected of it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If the rest end chanced to be in align with the tool end so much the better, but it these two parts were not in alignment it did not attract notice. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If the tools held in the brace wobbled more or less it might create dissatisfaction on the part of its owner in certain work, but that same owner did not expect any better tool in early days.</description>

            <title>Building a Razee Jack Plane - Part 1 by Joe Laviolette‎</title>
            <description>Some of the tools I use in my woodworking I build myself. I especially like to build my planes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Although I built several of them already, I always enjoy every new project. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In this article I will show how I build a Razee style Jack Plane. My plan calls for 14 inches plane with a single, 2 inches wide iron.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I start with selection of the material.</description>

            <title>The Tool That Made the Tools by Geoffrey Tweedale</title>
            <description>What was the most significant and widely used tool in nineteenth-century Sheffield?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The answer is not immediately obvious.&lt;br /&gt;
After surveying publications on the history of tools and exploring the world of tool-collecting buffs, one might imagine that woodworking tools (saws, planes, and joiners’ braces) were of prime importance. If not those, then perhaps another category of edge tools, such as shears or scythes, were paramount. Or maybe engineers’ tools – spanners, wrenches, hammers, and drills – took first place. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The answer might surprise. As far back as 1787 – when a Sheffield directory provided the first reasonably detailed breakdown of trades by category – file making had become the primary tool trade.</description>

&lt;br /&gt;
Today ALFIE came rushing back from the garden to tell me Doctor Who had parked his blinkin&apos; TARDIS in the cabbage patch again! &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The second time in a year!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He was kind enough to take us shopping to the middle of the 20th century to be precise. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We only had a few bob in old money, so an expensive tool was out. But in a little shop behind the brewery in Maidstone we found a little William Marples wooden coffin smoother... so we bought it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It was time for tea and crumpets so we had to come back but we did bring the plane into the workshop to share with you all!</description>

            <title>Smoke Prints - Documenting Planemaker Marks  by Amy Harrington McAuley‎</title>
            <description>Recently I was looking at the Goodman&apos;s appendix (British Planemakers from 1700) and ran across a small chapter about smoke prints and how helpful they can be in looking at maker stamps and user marks. So I set out on today&apos;s adventure.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We did have a fine tea strainer in the house but I was FORBIDDEN to use it. So I took a small walk to our local spice shop and picked up a cheap strainer. At home I tore it apart and fashioned a handle that I could hold with my bum hand. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Following the instructions in Goodman I was pretty pleased with how they came out. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I was a little bit concerned about burning or harming the wood but it seemed to do nothing at all. I figured if Jane Rees uses this method it would do no harm. I think it will be a good way to catalog my planes for research and insurance purposes.&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>Like her namesake, this one was due for the scrapheap. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But as she sailed into this Kentish harbor, she was put in dry dock assessed by Able Seaman ALFIE! as being restorable. And so we set about repairs.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This is one untouched example of this fine No.27. And I love the age. I am sure this must be one of the early ones. It has issues... but so would you after over 100 years!</description>

            <title>MF Langdon Miter Box, Model 16-1/2 by John M. Johnston</title>
            <description>About ten years ago I acquired a small mitre box that I have now learned is a Millers Falls Langdon Model 16 1/2 with its original Disston 16&quot; x 2&quot; saw blade (see the catalog page). &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Because the saw now measures 1-3/4&quot; below the spine, it no longer cuts below the bottom plates. I added a sacrificial board and adjusted the height of the saw guides and used it that way for years. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Today I disassembled the box, cleaned with detergent and a stiff brush, and steel wool.</description>

            <title>X 5 Metal Plane - Union Manufacturing Co.  Photos provided by Paul McGee, Perth, AU</title>
            <description>The Union Manufacturing Co. catalog, published in 1905, introduced new metal plane design - the X Series.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It distinguished itself with a locking vertical post mechanism for adjusting the depth of cut. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
1905 Catalog Description:  In presenting this new adjustment, we are confident that we have the best that has yet been designed by any Plane manufacturer.

While it is somewhat of a departure from the accepted ideas of Plane adjustment, it is the result of careful study of the requirements of users of tools, and is in every point an improvement over the old.</description>

            <title>Harvey W. Peace &amp; Co., - Backsaw No. 50 with Brass Back and Open Handle</title>
            <description>This saw appeared on eBay in September, 2015. It was sold at the price of - &quot;best Offer&quot;, but originally priced at $625.00. I did not submit that winning offer. Photos below are from that auction. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It is a rare saw. I never seen Harvey W. Peace saw with open handle and brass back. The seller also stated that &quot;I&apos;ve only seen one open tote Peace saw with the Vulcan imprint in my 17 years of saw collecting and it was a steel back. Harvey Peace saws are seldom seen with a brass back but combined with an open tote and the spine imprint is a rarity.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The saw measures 10 inches, which would qualify it as a dovetail saw. The brass back appears to be massive. It is a &quot;folded&quot; brass bar with beveled edges. The handle appears to be apple wood.</description>

            <title>The Mystery of the 5300 Years Old Box by Jim Hendricks</title>
            <description>When we think of tsunami we usually think of the Far East but 5300 years ago, if the stories are to be believed, a huge tsunami swept across a tropical North Sea and hit the east coast of England.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What is now Norfolk was decimated and a huge forest of English oaks were flattened in a blink of an eye. The trees thus felled were instantly buried below the bog and starved of oxygen and so did not decay as other plant life would.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Five millennia later, irate Fenland farmers caught their ploughs in these mighty oaks exposed by centuries of farming. Initially, they burnt the offending obstructions by the ton until the immense value of this wood was realized and they were harvested for the gorgeous timber it yielded.</description>

            <title>Modifying a Stanley 151 Spokeshave by Will Myers</title>
            <description>On a recent project I realized I needed a better spokeshave for concave surfaces. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The one I have been using is a small wooden bodied shave that works well but is hard to get it to cut fine enough for close work. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I have several Stanley 151 and 152 shaves and really like the screw adjustment mechanism for the cutting iron on these. It allows you to set them for a very fine cut which is nice, especially in end grain situations.</description>

            <title>Building a Twist-Lock Marking Gauge by Jim Hendricks</title>
            <description>Recently I received a beautiful old rosewood twist-lock marking gauge.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I thought that this would make a superb tool to build. Something simple, yet deceptively clever.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
First we will discuss stock selection, show how the original was measured and how these dimensions are transferred to the raw stock.</description>

            <title>Making a Basic Jewelry Box - by P. Michael Henderson</title>
            <description>Boxes are a good woodworking project. They are good learning projects, requiring design, accuracy, and joinery - and they don&apos;t take a lot of wood. In fact, you can often use off-cuts from other projects.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And they make good gifts for family members.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are many, many ways to make a box, limited only by your imagination. For this tutorial, I had to choose one style, and since it&apos;s a beginner&apos;s box, I chose a fairly simple design. But, as you will see, even a simple box has a lot of steps.</description>

            <title>Dovetail Joints - Manufacturer and Builder, 1865</title>
            <description>The strongest and most permanent joint made in carpentry and cabinet-making, where pieces of wood are fastened together at right angles, is the dovetail.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When made in some of its most approved and perfected forms, it is equal in neatness and artistic finish to the miter joint. The miter is a comparatively neater method of joining wood at an angle, but the dovetail possesses the greatest possible strength.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It is generally employed in articles made of thin materials, such, for instance, as drawers, boxes, chests, etc. If we examine a dovetailed box, we observe that it consists of six pieces, or sides, four of which arc interlaced, or dovetailed together at the corners, forming a rigid frame-work. This is shown in Fig. 1.</description>

            <description>I finally can do something with that walnut! For ages now I have had a nice lump of English walnut sitting in the workshop.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
t was a gift from my mate Douglas and I&apos;ve wanted to do something special with it. So today I finally got off my backside and out into the summer sunshine with my best mate ALFIE...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I have a number of 19th century examples, all with something needing doing to them!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
One has lost its bit release button... one has a repaired crack... and the worst but prettiest.. has been in and out if ICU over many decades and in a sorry state indeed! So, I thought I&apos;d make a KT Tools one.</description>

            <title>Getting the Most from the Millers Falls MF 1 “Cigar Shave”</title>
            <description>The Millers Falls &apos;cigar&apos; shave is probably one of my favorite tools but it used to drive me bonkers!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Sharpened and set right, it&apos;s one of the most versatile tools ever and can do things absolutely no other can. It shaves very tight radius internal curves...yet runs true on the flat... turning to external curves with ease.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But, and it&apos;s a huge BUT, most are left on the shelf unused because they are either not razor sharp or the user can&apos;t get the setting right or both.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In this article I will show how to sharpen the strange cutter, then when that variable is removed, how to set it to cut efficiently and with ease.</description>

            <title>A Woodworker’s Rose (brace) by Jason Stamper</title>
            <description>Several years ago I bought a lot of 5 bit braces on eBay. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I think I paid around $30 for 5 of them, and it seems the rust scared off the other bidders.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In any event, I was thrilled with what I ended up with. I got a cheap Stanley (which I have long since traded off), an early all iron Fray, a small odd blacksmith made one, a rare Holt brace, and possibly my favorite a rare Rose (Millers Falls) brace.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Most of these braces needed serious cleaning, and several were missing parts. However, nothing was cracked or un-fixable, so I was thrilled. In this article I am going to focus on the Rose brace, but I will do a few follow up articles on the others.</description>

            <title>Skills of the Sheffield Hand Forger by Geoffrey Tweedale</title>
            <description>This sepia photograph of a Sheffield hand forger – apparently at the leading pocket-knife firm of George Wostenholm &amp; Son – is undated. But it is certainly pre-1914 and may be even earlier (perhaps from the 1890s). The photo is mounted on a small card and measures only about 10cm square. Nevertheless, one can see clearly into the forger’s workshop with its open hearth, array of tongs, forging block, and anvil. The forger himself holds a hammer with a wooden handle that has been worn to shape by years of use. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The posed stance, with the forger seeming to gaze wistfully through the unglazed window, only tells part of the story. Forgers at work never stood still or sat down. They were too busy working the bellows, moving blades in and out of the fire, and repeatedly hammering and manipulating them. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Hand forging was strenuous – indeed, it was one of the most arduous jobs in the Sheffield trades – though many forgers seem to have thrived on the work.</description>

            <title>Atkins Passes Half Century Mark - Barrel and Box, 1915</title>
            <description>It is certainly an enviable record when an institution can boast of having been established over half a century.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
September 17 was an epoch-making period in the history of E. C. Atkins &amp; Co., of Indianapolis, Ind., maker of the celebrated silver steel saws, as that date marked the fifty-eight anniversary of the founding of that institution, one of the oldest and largest industries in Indiana.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A story of the growth of the company will doubtless prove interesting to the readers of the Barrel and Box.</description>

            <description>The Standard, No. 999
is one of the nicer saws produced by the Monhagen Saw Works.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The 1895 catalog of National Saw Co. describes it as &quot;Extra Refined Spring Steel with Polished and Carved Apple Handle, Five Improved Screws.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&apos;ve handled many saws from most of the major American manufacturers over the years that I&apos;ve been refurbishing. This has given me an opportunity to evaluate their overall general quality and especially the quality of steel used for making the saw plates. I&apos;ve also sharpened over a thousand saws, which has further provided me with an insight into quality of the plate material and quality of workmanship employed in processing of this most important part of a saw.</description>

            <title>Special Plane by James E. Price</title>
            <description>Did you ever use a plane that felt like you were wearing it like a glove?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This old plane is so unusual that I simply must share it with you.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I have owned this plane for four years but I first saw it forty-eight years ago right after a friend of mine, Bruce Debo of Devils Elbow Missouri, bought it in an area of central Missouri that was homeland to early German settlers. Bruce was an Ozark coffin maker and every time I visited his shop I admired this old plane.</description>

Soon I would be honored to be close to a treasure very few are privileged to experience. Not only viewing the tool world&apos;s greatest treasure, but touching and examining each and every tool... to live history.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The chest is normally kept behind glass in its own room in Rochester&apos;s Guildhall Museum, a short 20 minute drive from my house in northwest Kent, some 30 miles southeast of London.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

            <title>Sparks No. 70 by Douglas Coates</title>
            <description>For a small island we have more than our share of the best plane-makers here in the UK.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Karl Holtey, Bill Carter, Phil Edwards and others have set a World-class standard but it is exciting to see a new maker appearing. It’s also very pleasing to find that demand for premium hand-made tools is strong.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Oliver Sparks is still young in years but he radiates a passion for the craft that is backed by rigorous research and thorough knowledge. His planes exude that elusive ‘master’s touch’. He will go far quite quickly, no doubt about it.</description>

            <title>Classic English Mortise Chisel - The &quot;Pig Sticker&quot; by Jim Hendricks</title>
            <description>For years I have been attracted to tools that were uniquely British...the infills...the wooden moulding planes and perhaps the most unique...the &quot;delicately&quot; named &quot;pig sticker&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This type of mortise chisel shouts &quot;mean and nasty&quot; and its bark truly is as sharp as its bite!!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Recently... the English mortise chisel, to give it its correct name, has been the focus of new interest... due in no small part to the folks at Tools For Working Wood and the great toolmaker Ray Iles... so I have placed a link at the bottom for anyone interested in further reading.</description>

            <title>Making Files by Hand at Kearney &amp; Foot - American Machinist, 1880</title>
            <description>The process of making files by hand-cutting, though carried on from the time files were first used, is imperfectly understood by the great body of mechanics, in its present improved state.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We have recently given some special attention to the subject, and will endeavor to describe the process as carried on in what we believe to be the largest factory producing exclusively hand-cut files in this country.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When purchased, the steel is taken to the store room, which contains twenty-five tons and upwards. From the store room it is taken to the forging shop, where it is cut to the required lengths for forging. Each length is then piled away by itself.</description>

            <title>Hand Plane Basics - part 3 - Sharpening by Bill Rittner</title>
            <description>Well, to date we have found an inexpensive vintage plane. We disassembled it, learned what the parts are, cleaned and de-rusted it, and made any necessary repairs. The next step to putting this plane back to work is to sharpen the iron/blade and fit the capiron.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
No matter how pretty your tool looks if it’s cutting edge is not sharp it will never work properly. Sharpening is the key to making any cutting tool work as it was designed to. Whenever you encounter a problem cutting with a tool the first thing you should do is to sharpen it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you have been around hand woodworking tools for any time you know that there are as many methods of sharpening as there are hand tool woodworkers. The key to an enjoyable hand tool experience is picking a sharpening method that best suits your budget and needs and sticking with it until you become proficient. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The time wasted trying all the latest, greatest methods and equipment is better spent mastering the method you started with. Leave the atomic powered laser sharpener on the tool suppliers shelf, at least until you have mastered the system you began with. Then, and only then will you have the knowledge and experience to know what to look for in order to make your sharpening system even more efficient.</description>

            <title>Selecting and Using Files by James F. Hobart, 1885</title>
            <description>How many machinists know a good file when they see it?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I don&apos;t believe one in fifty can take a pile of files and pick out the best one. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The average man will pick up two or three, turn them over, squint along the corners, pick out the straightest one and call it as &quot;good as any.&quot; They don&apos;t seem to have any idea that a file may be soft, or fire-cracked, or burned. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If they were choosing a cold chisel, they would look out for all these things, but &quot;a file is a file&quot; so long as it has teeth and tang.</description>

            <title>Saving the Stewart by Jim Hendricks</title>
            <description>I just received this in the post, eBAY as usual, and cheap as chips.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The seller even emailed me afterwards to check that I had seen the chip out of the horn!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Well... that&apos;s the least of the problems sir!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As you can see the handle is completely broken in a number of places and &quot;repaired&quot; in one. That last &quot;repair&quot; is the most difficult part of the restoration.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I am keeping as much original as possible and over the next few weeks I shall be posting some of the tips and wrinkles I&apos;ve picked up over the years so that others may feel confident to restore a treasure back to working condition.</description>

            <title>Stanley No. 45 Case I Made in 1975 by James E. Price</title>
            <description>This plane has special memories for me and it is one of the first planes I cased right after I learned how to cut dovetails by hand.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I didn&apos;t have much choice of seasoned wood back then so an old farmer gave me some willow oak boards that he had in the loft of his barn and fashioned this box from them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The box was made to hold the 45 with the long rods in it and to store the cased cutters at one end.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The plane is held firmly in place with a bridle and rod ends are inserted in holes in a bracket on the back wall of the box. This has been very effective in keeping the plane fully restrained inside the case.</description>

            <title>Marvels of Modern Tool Making - Saws by Bernard L. Johnson, 1912</title>
            <description>“I understand, Mr. Editor, you are now something of a saw maker,” the Boss Carpenter observed as he slid into the visitor’s chair and helped himself to a pipe full of our tobacco.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
“Well no, we&apos;d hardly want to claim that,&quot; we rejoined, “To become a saw maker - a modern saw maker you understand - has taken some 5,000 years. We do know a good saw though, when we get hold of one; and you better believe we have a greater admiration and respect for these faithful tools now, after seeing exactly how they are made, than we ever had before.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
“You know we have always been a crank on good tools, and especially saws. We have been uncommonly interested in these, probably because of their ancient and honorable origin. In a few minutes you will hear something about some old and curious saws, and will see then the sentiment that clings around every high grade carpenters’ saw today for us literary fellows. You are so hard headed and practical probably a saw is just a saw to you, and so long as it does its work that&apos;s all you care.”</description>

            <title>The Old Brace &amp; Bit - an Exercise in Creative Writing by Jason Stamper</title>
            <description>Indulge me for a moment if you will dear reader, for I would like to tell you about an old friend. This friend came from Sheffield, England nearly two centuries ago.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This friend, born in the 1830’s, serves as real window into the past, and a reminder of simpler times. Even with its tremendous age it has never let me down, and I shall be quite surprised if it ever does.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Who is this friend you ask. Why it is a wooden brace of the type used to turn various boring bits. And although I do not use it every day, when I do it is a great joy to use.</description>

            <title>Disston D8 - full size 28&quot;, 5 ppi Rip Saw, 1880s - a review by Daryl Weir</title>
            <description>One of Disston’s main stays in production line was the ever popular D8 thumbhole or dual grip rip saw. The saw shown here is an early 1880&apos;s era, 28&quot; (blade length) with a 5ppi graduated to 6ppi at the point. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In recent years the term &quot;variable pitch&quot; has been used on saws that have &quot;graduated teeth&quot;. Historically, this term is actually not correct.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;Pitch&quot; was a term used in all of the old catalogs and saw literature that meant the same as the &quot;rake&quot; on the front of the teeth. Think of it as the same as the &quot;pitch&quot; on your roof. &quot;Pitch&quot; is used on screws or threads and to my knowledge was never used on saws back in the day.</description>

            <description>Racking is as old as vises are! End vises, face vises, Moxon vises... Most seem to suffer from it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Over the last twenty years or so, there has been a hand tool renaissance, and there are thousands of resources for hand tool enthusiasts out there. Oddly, when one searches for ways to solve the racking problem, there seem to be far fewer ideas to deal with it.</description>

            <title>Stringing or Purfling Saw by James E. Price</title>
            <description>Over a period of at least 50 years I have made many of my own woodworking tools to fulfill special needs.&lt;br /&gt;
The best way to describe the tool in the photos is that it is a saw. I know, it does not look like a saw but it is a saw I use to insert wooden stringing or purfling into some of my projects.</description>

            <title>Three Little Castings by Jim Hendricks</title>
            <description>One day, flicking through eBay 
I stumbled on these three little orphans.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Having won the auction for a song…(after all…they WERE three old rusty hulks!)… I asked the seller if he knew anything of the history.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He replied that he did not know much other than his grandfather said he got them from his father with a view to completing them and alas... neither achieved their goal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
So that puts them into the Victorian era… a time when purchasing castings from the foundry was the cheaper option taken by many craftsmen who were quite capable of finishing them off. After all, planes of this quality were a week’s wage for many a cabinet maker of the era!</description>

            <title>Planing Board - Workshop Appliances by Cecil Rogers</title>
            <description>You don&apos;t need a planing board. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But, if you have one, you will use it... a LOT!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Using battens, doe&apos;s feet, holdfasts, planing stops, and other appliances, a proper woodworking bench will perform every single task that a planing board will. So, what&apos;s the advantage? What could it possibly have to offer if one can use other methods of work? Why build one of these &quot;space takers?&quot; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The short answer is speed and ease of setup, combined with rock solid support.</description>

            <description>The multi-blade knife has a history that stretches back at least a couple of hundred years.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It was in the late 19th century that the multi-blade knife reached its peak in terms of workmanship, quality, and finish.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The leading centre for their manufacture was Sheffield.</description>

            <title>Building a Trestle Table - part 2 by Will Myers</title>
            <description>The next step in the trestle table build is the long stretchers. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The length of these are of course variable to whatever length of table you want to make. The stretchers for this table are 63in long overall by 1 1/4in thick and 3 1/2in tall yellow pine. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The have a 5in long by 2 1/2in tall tenon cut on either end to create a tusk tenon that will be joined to the legs. It is best to do the layout of the tenon shoulders with the stretchers clamped together to assure the shoulders locations are the same on both pieces. I used a mortise gauge set to 2 1/2in and centered on the width of the stretcher to lay out the width of the tenon then rip them out and sawed the shoulders.</description>

            <title>Building a Bench Hook by Cecil Rogers</title>
            <description>A bench hook is nothing more than three sticks of wood.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
More often than not, they can be made of scraps and cutoffs. Designs can be dirt simple or very involved. Even the simple designs can change depending on the goal of its use, but with a little planning, they can be turned into double or triple duty appliances. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Once built, many appliances will last a lifetime. Some will not. Bench hooks fit into the second group. Over time, they will get beat on, cut, pounded, and used up. It&apos;s just the nature of the beast. I built a few of the very involved versions early on. It adds time and complexity to something I&apos;ve discovered, at least for me, should be kept dirt simple.</description>

            <title>Matt’s Dutch Tool Chest by Matthew R. Lisk</title>
            <description>After several years of accumulating tools and having less than ideal ways to store them, I finally decided this would be the year for a proper tool chest.&lt;br /&gt;
My last &quot;tool chest&quot; was an old GI foot locker that I had picked up at a yard sale. It held all of my tools, but it was greatly lacking in both form and function. &lt;br /&gt;
I had read several articles and books on tool chests and was nearly set on building a traditional floor chest based on Chris Schwarz’s book, The Anarchist’s Tool Chest.&lt;br /&gt;
Ultimately I needed something that would be fairly quick to build, so I settled on the Dutch tool chest featured in the October 2013 issue of Popular Woodworking (I recommend picking up or downloading a copy if you plan on building this chest).&lt;br /&gt;
Not only was this chest surprisingly quick to build, it holds a ton of tools and put many different hand tool skills to the test.</description>

            <description>Without any doubt my little Scottish infill panel plane is my most “go to” plane of all.&lt;br /&gt;
Another masterpiece from my favourite auction site, this plane came to me fairly cheaply but in need of quite a bit of work.&lt;br /&gt;
The first thing to tackle was the chip to the rear handle… as the sharp edge was very uncomfortable to hold...</description>

            <title>English Joiners&apos; Tallow Pots by James E. Price</title>
            <description>It was a chilly, rainy day on the Ozark Border all day so it was a good excuse to hide in the shop and make something useful...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Today&apos;s project is a tallow pot, a small wooden box in which beef or mutton tallow or sometimes beeswax were kept for lubricating the soles of planes and the blades of backsaws. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When coated with wax or tallow the sole of a plane glides over the wood with little resistance and a good backsaw won&apos;t bind or chatter in the kerf due to the lubricant.</description>

            <title>Portable Planing Board by Jim Harvey</title>
            <description>Lately I’ve gotten much more interested in using hand tools...&lt;br /&gt;
I don’t have a real bench though, just an old office desk and there is not a good way to hold a board down flat to work on it. Holdfasts just don’t work well with an office desk.&lt;br /&gt;
My 11×48 inch planing board clamps easily in the bench front vise, or in a Work Mate. I made a cam arrangement to secure the work. There are 3/4 inch holes every 2 inches down the rigid spine. It takes a pair of cams to cover the 2 inch range. In this photo the larger cam is lying on the bench at rear along with the home made spanner wrench used to torque the cams.</description>

            <title>J. Taylor &amp; Son - 26 inch Hand Saw by Daryl Weir</title>
            <description>The English saws are not my specialty, but this one caught my eye... I purchased it on a whim from eBay a while back.&lt;br /&gt;
Now, I knew this saw was in rough shape when I bought it. &lt;br /&gt;
However, it appeared to have an interesting handle – the wood had an open grain and I suspected it is either mahogany or rosewood. &lt;br /&gt;
The five iron screws appeared to be somewhat crudely made.</description>

            <title>My Routers and How I Use Them by James E. Price</title>
            <description>As I was using my favorite D router today and listened to the cutter shaving the wood from a recess and marveled at how quiet it was compared to the scream of an electric router.&lt;br /&gt;
That is why I like to use unplugged tools. I can hear and feel how the blade is engaging the wood. I have owned this old router for years and each time I get it out to use I marvel at the patina on it from decades of use.</description>

            <title>Addis: A Famous Name in Carving Tools By Geoffrey Tweedale</title>
            <description>In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, only a few manufacturers established a reputation in the niche market of carving tools for woodwork. &lt;br /&gt;
These included Henry Taylor, Robert Marples, Robert and I. &amp; H. Sorby, and Ashley Iles. They were based in Sheffield. &lt;br /&gt;
However, the first enterprise to carve its name (as it were) into carving tools manufacture was Addis. It was once said that ‘the best, and indeed the only [carving tools] that are fit for use, are made by Mr. Addis’ (T. Martin, The Circle of the Mechanical Arts, 1813). Addis was based in London.</description>

            <title>Scottish Boxwood Infill Smoother by Jim Hendricks</title>
            <description>I often trawl the eBay looking for little orphan infill planes...&lt;br /&gt;
... simply because I couldn’t afford pristine collector examples at the time and partly because I enjoy the challenge of making a basket case into something useable.&lt;br /&gt;
One such lost child was this Scottish infill smoother.</description>

            <title>Hand Plane Basics - part 2 by Bill Rittner</title>
            <description>Now that all the parts of the #5 plane have been thoroughly cleaned, de-rusted and inspected, as can be seen in the photo above, it is time for the next step. All parts of the plane are shown in the photo except the knob and tote. These wood parts are being stripped and refinished and will be installed later.&lt;br /&gt;
The next thing that needs to be done is to determine that the sole of the plane is flat. This plane still shows the pattern of the original factory grinding so no work needs to be done to the sole or the sides. You can check the flatness of your plane’s sole using a good quality, (such as Browne &amp; Sharp or Starrett), steel scale, commonly called a rule, and a feeler gage.</description>

            <description>&quot;If you want a Saw, it is best to get one with a name on it which has a reputation. A man who has made a reputation for his goods knows its value, as well as its cost, and will maintain it.&quot; - Henry Disston&lt;br /&gt;
The D115 &amp; D15 were Disston&apos;s most expensive hand saw offerings in the 1914 catalog.</description>

            <title>House for a Homeless Stanley 45 by Jim Harvey</title>
            <description>As far as I can tell, this particular 45 dates from the late 50s. Almost new! It was a Christmas present to myself.&lt;br /&gt;
Actually, I already had a 45 but dropped it onto the concrete garage floor. In a fit of despair, I bid on this 45 on eBay and won.&lt;br /&gt;
Meanwhile I was able to repair the cracked main stock on the first 45 so now I have two of them working. Neither came with an original box which was likely cardboard anyway. Hence this project. Guess I will have to build two of them.</description>

            <title>Skelton Dovetail Saw Review by Jim Hendricks</title>
            <description>First of all... huge thanks to Shane for the chance to have a look at this fine saw.&lt;br /&gt;
And fine it is… as in &quot;fine art&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
Before I begin my findings... I will emphasize that I am looking at this mostly from an aesthetic and ergonomic standpoint.&lt;br /&gt;
I will leave other to review &quot;making dovetails&quot;. I am sure there are some who are past masters at this! However, things repeated stay in the mind after all!&lt;br /&gt;
I&apos;ve spoken with Shane at length... he has a true passion for his craft and the attention to detail is astounding. This extends to the packaging, which when you buy a boutique saw, is sort of expected but often absent these days.</description>

            <title>Acme 120 No-Set, 26 inch Rip Saw, 1910 era by Daryl Weir</title>
            <description>&quot;Disston&quot; on Saws is a Guarantee of Quality!&lt;br /&gt;
No. 120 Acme, skewback blade, extra London spring steel, selected and polished, warranted. &lt;br /&gt;
Apple handle, carved and polished, five brass screws. &lt;br /&gt;
Specially Made to Work Without Set for Smooth Cutting in Dry Lumber.&lt;br /&gt;
This saw is from the 1910 era and still has a nice wide blade, one of its pluses. The keystone etch is pretty much gone, the secondary etch and tertiary &quot;Acme&quot; etch is partially there but honestly, all is pretty much impossible to read.</description>

            <title>Building a 19th Century-style Parlor Guitar, Part 2 – The Body  with Jason Stamper</title>
            <description>With the neck and headstock roughed out I moved on to making the body of the guitar. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The first thing I did was to plane the material down to the correct thickness on my thickness planer. Then I joined the top and back pieces up. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I did this by putting a ruler under the joint on a piece of plywood and then clamping the outside edges down while keeping the joint tight. Once the edge clamps were in place I pulled the ruler out and pressed the center seam down with a caul and more clamps.</description>

            <description>I finally decided that hanging all my saws from two hooks on the wall wasn&apos;t good enough any more, so I started on a saw till.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Dimensions are 24&quot; wide, 40&quot; tall. Basic, open style with slanted sides. The bottom is 6&quot; deep and I will build either two drawers and a cubby, or three drawers.</description>

            <title>John Sorby &amp; Sons and Lockwood Brothers - Sheffield, UK</title>
            <description>John Sorby &amp; Sons became one of the most famous firms making sheep shears and woodworking augers for shipwrights in first part of 19th Century. The designs of these tools were patented.&lt;br /&gt;
In 1844, Lockwood Brothers acquired John Sorby &amp; Sons and continued to use their trade mark, name and factory at Spital Hill Works. They capitalized on the John Sorby &amp; Sons&apos; fame to the fullest.&lt;br /&gt;
Hanging Sheep, a sign he later hung over the entrance to his factory, was John Sorby&apos;s trade mark.</description>

            <title>E. C. Atkins Perfection No. 53 - Scew-Back Hand Saw, 26&quot; long, 10 ppi - c. 1910 by Daryl Weir</title>
            <description>&quot;Skillful mechanics everywhere instantly recognize the merits of this Saw&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
Here&apos;s a nice example of a late 1910 era Atkins &quot;SILVER STEEL&quot; No.53. It&apos;s a cross cut hand saw, filed at 10ppi, with the blade being 26&quot; long.&lt;br /&gt;
As you would expect, it has the embossed apple &quot;Perfection&quot; handle which Atkins started using, instead of the carved handle, around 1912.</description>

            <title>Big Ripsaw and Crosscut Saw Project by Dominic Greco</title>
            <description>I wanted to build a full sized rip and crosscut saws for a while now. Until recently I didn&apos;t have access to large widths of 0.042&quot; steel. But that changed and I was ready to work.&lt;br /&gt;
Along with that steel I also picked up a Beverly Slitting Shear. This little gem allows me to cut spring steel like it was paper. Now that all the pieces were in place I decided it was time to layout a rip and cross cut saw prototype. I used AutoCad to design the saw plates to meet the hang line of a couple of my favorite saw handles - the Wheeler Madden &amp; Clemson as well as the old Disston D-7. Once I had these laid out I printed out the plans and went to town on the saw plates.</description>

            <description>Part war of attrition... part friendship... and mostly encouragement was all I needed to get my backside out into the shop again and make a prototype tool… as suggested by a very good friend of mine Toby Nava.&lt;br /&gt;
So having absolutely no idea where to start a few more head scratchings and observations of other fine tools led me to make one… and by chance one for me too! (how clever was that!!)&lt;br /&gt;
Steel….O1... of course... 3mm ground gauge plate&lt;br /&gt;
Toby requested 6 1/2&quot; of tooth area and a total length of 8&quot; so that’s the dimensions. In retrospect... and if I ever make another..</description>

            <title>The Plot Thickens – The Berg Hand Tools Revisited by Kim Malmberg</title>
            <description>I have written several stories about the Erik Anton Berg manufacturing company. Mostly I have been engaged in trying to date company line of tools depending on stamps and logotypes.&lt;br /&gt;
Much new and hard evidence had surfaced since the previous stories, which has effectively crushed several loose theories. Which is all good. &lt;br /&gt;
This particular story will not be so much about the type study or dating Berg tools, as it is about the new findings which have occurred, very much regardless of my work, but through evidence brought forward by people such as my good friend Glen Crook in Canada, author of the website Galootopia, Randall Nelson, a collector of unusual chisels, but also through the Facebook group Gamla verktyg and the detective work by Fredrik Dahlstedt.</description>

            <description>I am often asked how to get started using handplanes. So, here goes.  &lt;br /&gt;
I chose the plane pictured below for this article because it is common and inexpensive. It is a modern Stanley #5 jack plane made in England. I bought it at a flea market for $7. &lt;br /&gt;
My purpose is to show you that just about any plane can be made to work well with some knowledge and work. The object of this article will be to make this plane work well not to make it look pretty.</description>

            <title>Making the Ron Herman&apos;s Sawbench by Naveen Gogineni</title>
            <description>The first time I ever heard of a saw bench was from a Chris Schwarz article on Popular Woodworking.  The one in the pdf in the article was an intimidating one for me because of the mortise &amp; tenon joints etc. &lt;br /&gt;
After doing a bunch of research I came across another saw bench, again by C. S., but with &quot;easier&quot; joints. &lt;br /&gt;
I&apos;ve been using that bench for many months now and I completely agree with Chris&apos;s statement that using a handsaw without a saw bench is like trying to use a router without securing your work. You can do it in a pinch, but your results usually suffer.</description>

            <title>Sorby: A Famous Sheffield Tool Making Family by Geoffrey Tweedale</title>
            <description>‘SORBY’ is a well-known name in Sheffield tool and cutlery manufacture.&lt;br /&gt;
The family was an old one, whose members became prominent in the town’s affairs as magistrates and local government officials. The first Master Cutler (the head of the local craft guild) in 1624 was Robert Soresby (the name has had various spellings). Other Sorbys later held that post. &lt;br /&gt;
By the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, several Sorby tool and cutlery businesses thrived in Sheffield. Their history is featured in tool reference books, on internet sites, and in company literature. &lt;br /&gt;
Much has been made of the family’s ancient links to the first Master Cutler, its worthy municipal record, its illustrious descendants (one of them was the scientist, Henry Clifton Sorby), and the longevity of its industrial activities.&lt;br /&gt;
Unfortunately, that reported history is incomplete. Moreover, the complex family and inter-firm linkages have bred endless confusion. Sorby’s business history therefore merits further investigation.</description>

            <description>This is a Warranted Superior hand saw. Nevertheless I will boldly state that it is one of the finest saws I have ever come across.&lt;br /&gt;
I cannot confirm the maker with absolute certainty, but the saw features a Warranted Superior medallion with the Disston keystone, so I’d be surprised if it was made by any other company.&lt;br /&gt;
Bear with me. The etch in my Supplee Hardware saw contains two rows of text identical, both in content and design, to a Woodrough McParlin hardware saw made for Sickels &amp; Nutting in Davenport, Iowa.</description>

            <title>Isaac Youngs Wall Clock  by Will Myers</title>
            <description>The Isaac Youngs wall clock is a decidedly timeless piece.&lt;br /&gt;
The original clock, made by Youngs in the 1840 is in the collection of Hancock Shaker Village, Hancock Mass. Even though time seems to be my worst enemy these days, I thought I would have a go at making one. &lt;br /&gt;
The overall measurements I used for this clock came from Ejner Handberg’s second volume of Shop Drawings of Shaker Furniture and Woodenware. Mr. Handberg’s dimensions were documented from the original clock.</description>

            <title>Rosewood Tote Repair Step by Step by Dominic Greco</title>
            <description>I used a couple small pieces of rosewood to repair this rosewood tote.&lt;br /&gt;
Now before you ask, &quot;Why go through all this mess? Just make a new one!&quot;, I&apos;ll give you my reasons.&lt;br /&gt;
First off, I really don&apos;t like making totes. 
I can shape them pretty easily, but I consistently mess up the drilling for the counter bore at the top. The only way I can see to make it full proof is to buy a counterbore bit.</description>

            <title>James Howarth &amp; Sons Ltd. by Geoffrey Tweedale</title>
            <description>James Howarth (1811-1891) was the son of William Howarth, an edge tool maker, and his wife, Hannah. James’ uncle, John, had been involved in Mottram &amp; Howarth, an edge tool manufacturer, which had been listed in a directory in 1811 in Bridge Street.&lt;br /&gt;
In 1823, James had joined his father as a 12-year-old second hand or striker (forger) at another edge tool maker, Mitchell Bros, in Furnival Street. James ‘soon learned how to make a good chisel … and by the time he reached the age of 22 he had gained so much of the confidence of his employers that he was entrusted with the duties of manager’ (Sheffield Independent, 31 July 1891).</description>

            <title>Make a Tote by Bill Rittner</title>
            <description>I have been making replacement knobs and totes for planes for a number of years and through this article hope to pass on some of the knowledge I have gained over that time. Making a new tote is not too difficult for the average woodworker, but explaining the entire process is rather complicated. &lt;br /&gt;
So I have chosen to break this article up into several parts to make it easier to digest.</description>

            <title>Spot the Fake by Kim Malmberg</title>
            <description>I love hand saws. All of them.&lt;br /&gt;
In any shape and size. Since woodworking in my case is merely an excuse for dealing with rust I tend to spend most of my shop time working on saws, rather than with them. &lt;br /&gt;
Where I live I can rarely find any decent saws. Most of them are badly beaten with ugly or broken handles and damaged saw plates. Which means I have a stack of donor saws where one can provide a plate...</description>

            <title>Reviving a Traditional Tool Chest by Jason Stamper</title>
            <description>A few years ago I bought and read Chris Schwarz’s book “The Anarchists Tool Chest.” When I found this book I was in the process of making a tool box with a lift up front. Even as I was making this toolbox, I realized it would end up being far too small for my burgeoning tool collection.&lt;br /&gt;
After reading the book and thinking about it, I decided I would need to build my own tool chest. At this point I stopped working on the first toolbox, it’s still not finished, and started planning for the larger tool chest. As fate would have it I discovered a very heavy antique tool chest at my favorite rusty iron dealer. I talked him down to $60, and loaded it in the back of our Explorer; along with the two panel saws I bought that day. As I have often jokingly told my dear wife, I have an iron deficiency.</description>

            <description>A Roubo Bookstand is made from a single piece of wood.&lt;br /&gt;
It opens as pictured or folds flat. The design is actually much older than Andre Roubo (he wrote in the 1770s), it is a traditional form for supporting the family Quran. Searching the Internet for “Roubo Bookstand” will keep you busy for many hours.</description>

            <title>Re-cutting and Re-sizing Saw Teeth with Paul Sellers</title>
            <description>No matter the reason, this video show you how simple it is to cut new saw teeth in any handsaw. &lt;br /&gt;
Yes, that means from small dovetail saws to the largest hand saws you have. If you have a saw you ruined, then file off the teeth and reach for your junior hacksaw. You are on your way to a saw tooth re-cut you won&apos;t regret no matter the maker old and new. &lt;br /&gt;
I so hope you enjoy the work that went into this and that you like what I have done to reach out to real woodworkers around the world.</description>

            <title>Testing the “Richard Tomes” Memorial Infill Panel Plane by Jim Hendricks</title>
            <description>This week I finally had opportunity to get the plane tested by Douglas Coates of Coats England who is not only one of this country’s fine craftsmen in wood… but a good friend and a very honest critic of things wood in general, so I knew his views during testing would not be sugar coated!&lt;br /&gt;
His workshop in the heart of Sevenoaks is ideal for the test because it’s a “proper” workshop... unlike mine which is more akin to the set of Steptoe and Son!</description>

            <title>Building a 19th Century Style Parlor Guitar by Jason Stamper</title>
            <description>I have always been a good guitar player and it is my favorite instrument to play, so I decided to go for a 19th century parlor guitar.&lt;br /&gt;
The guitar is far more complex than the early banjo, but I was determined to give it a try. &lt;br /&gt;
This instrument is being based on a Martin 1-18 guitar plan, and is very small compared to a modern guitar.</description>

The fact that I prefer to work in wood had not escaped Richard’s keen eye… and also that I admired his wonderful work with creating dovetails in steel and anyone who has successfully done so in wood will know that doing this with steel is nothing short of alchemy!</description>

            <title>The Eleven Grooved Box – Tools Update by Jim Harvey</title>
            <description>I have an improved fixture for making Eleven Grooved Box splines. 

Roy Underhill’s video shows the spline blank placed in a grooved block. Then the blank is planed to size with a block plane.&lt;br /&gt;
The problem is, this eventually cuts some off the top surface of the grooved block causing the splines to come out too small. Then the splines won’t do their job well and look terrible.&lt;br /&gt;
My improved method has three secret weapons:&lt;br /&gt;
1. A Kerfing Plane to make the blanks&lt;br /&gt;
2. A modified Dado plane with skewed blade&lt;br /&gt;
3. A sizing block with a channel to guide the modified plane</description>

            <title>Building a Stair Saw by Dominic Greco</title>
            <description>I just started working on a new project in which I will build a stair saw based on an old Disston Stair saw loaned to me by Buckaroo. &lt;br /&gt;
I drew up the profile and made myself a temple of the handle. I also took the time to draw up a profile of the saw plate and get it&apos;s measurements down.&lt;br /&gt;
I used a caliper to measure the thickness of the sawplate and was sort of surprised to find that it was 0.032&quot; thk.&lt;br /&gt;
But I guess this would stand to reason since you would want a stiff saw plate for cuts where it was extended away from the handle.&lt;br /&gt;
Before really digging into the building process, I like to get all the raw material together and cut to rough size. Tonight I started on the saw plate.</description>

            <description>In Scott Landis’s &quot;The Work Bench Book&quot; there is a drawing of a ratchet mechanism
for a parallel guide.&lt;br /&gt;
It was one of those little tidbits I tend to file away in my head thinking I might try sometime. &lt;br /&gt;
In the book the guide is a solid piece of iron with teeth cut in the lower side that engage a plate mounted to the leg of the bench. &lt;br /&gt;
A simple foot lever arrangement raises the guide above the plate when you need to close up the chop of the vise.</description>

            <title>Coffeyville Kansas Patented Oiler Discovered in Oklahoma by Michael Urness</title>
            <description>Several years ago, while attending the SWTCA tool show in Tulsa Oklahoma, I had the good fortune to spend a few hours visiting with Tim Hoss, the show&apos;s host.&lt;br /&gt;
The day before the show started, Tim took me to his house to show me the progress being made on its remodeling. After walking thru the house, we retired to the garage where Tim&apos;s tools are temporarily being housed.&lt;br /&gt;
In one of the totes of planes was an Ohio Tool Co. No. 04 smooth plane that has a brass front knob. It didn&apos;t look like anything special. In fact it is a plane that I and many other tool collectors might have walked past if we had seen it on a table at a tool show.</description>

            <title>British Saws and Saw Makers from 1660 by Simon Barley</title>
            <description>My affair with English saws began a long time ago. Sometime around 1998 I met Ken Hawley  at his delectable tool shop in central Sheffield, renowned as the place that announced in the window &quot;We sell nowt [in local dialect &quot;nothing&quot;] but tools&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
Most of what I got there was new tools, but I also acquired from him the first set of hollows and rounds that helped me to get started on using moulding planes. I was by then several years into a major project of converting a 19th century stone barn into a house, and was more and more fascinated by the wonderful tools I could use – machinery frightened me, it made a terrible noise and dust, and it did not enable me to learn the feeling of the timber as I worked it.</description>

            <title>Saw Sharpening Bench by Bill Rittner</title>
            <description>For shop projects I don’t usually buy the materials, but try to use what I have, what I can repurpose, or can find from others discards. The first thing I found was the top. It is a high pressure laminated countertop that a cabinet maker in my building no longer wanted. &lt;br /&gt;
The leg stock is Douglas fir 4×4’s that I have had for many years. The oak board is door sill stock that I got from an estate cleanout several years ago. It will now be used for a shelf. In this case I did buy a Douglas fir 2x10x8 board because I needed apron stock and wanted to begin the project so I spent a few dollars on that. The final dimensions for the bench were driven by the already existing top which is 24 1/4 x 42 1/2.</description>

            <title>Special Etch Saws  by Kim Malmberg</title>
            <description>My largest hand tool fetish are saws. I have been using them since I was a child and I have always liked hand sawing, even when I got into power tools. So saws are always welcomed to my home, even when sound judgment tells me I shouldn&apos;t bother.&lt;br /&gt;
I might end up with some hopeless cases, some entirely useless ones, but sometimes even if the saw is beyond salvation, it might still provide something very useful. It might be parts, it might help my research regarding certain saw makers or it might reveal something unexpected.</description>

            <title>Erik Anton Berg – Maker of Pliers by Kim Malmberg</title>
            <description>In another story on this website I mentioned that the Erik Anton Berg company made a lot more than just chisels and plane irons. Berg was also a prominent maker of pliers, amongst other things.&lt;br /&gt;
I have an unhealthy affection for those odd tools. I like files, knives, measure tapes, and I like pliers. They are a necessity when I restore old tools, but they are also beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;
So there’s no surprise then that I have found myself collecting pliers. I’m not fussy. I like American ones, English and German ones, but most of all I am always on the lookout for Berg pliers.</description>

            <title>The Ironmonger - The King of Hardware Trade Journals By Geoffrey Tweedale</title>
            <description>Anyone who has picked up an old saw, plane, or knife soon looks for a trade mark or maker’s name. These can identify and sometimes date an artefact. But one often wants to know more about the history of the manufacturer or individual. Reference books and other published sources – such as newspapers and directories – can sometimes provide a lead. But they do not usually give much detail. Ideally, business records – letters, accounts ledgers, and old pattern books – should help. But not many tool and cutlery enterprises have left an archive trail. So where does one look?&lt;br /&gt;
In the late 1970s, I pondered this question, when I was researching the 19th century Sheffield cutlery and tool trades. I tried trawling through consecutive years of one Sheffield newspaper, but soon gave this up as too laborious. Trade journals seemed to offer a more focused source, so I began looking at leading Victorian periodicals, such as The Engineer and Engineering. These were useful and the volumes were often indexed.</description>

            <title>Unusual Panel Saw - American Saw Co. by Wiktor Kuc and Joe Steiner</title>
            <description>Some time ago Joe Steiner (former partner at Sauer &amp; Steiner Toolworks) sent me this email:

&quot;Hey Wiktor,
I don&apos;t know if this interests you but here are some pics of a saw from a co. that is the first example I have seen (maybe you have some examples) but which I would think are relatively scarce. The saw was in rough shape and the etching was nowhere to be seen behind some very thick rust. I saw the handle in a pile of saws and it screamed special. Cleaned it a bit but didn&apos;t want to go too far.&lt;br /&gt;
It will never be a collector or even a user saw because of the unfortunate breakage on the nose but what a cool etch. I wonder if this was advertising in a useful form for their patented removable teeth in the circular blades that they may be more famous for. I don&apos;t know if you want to include it in the stuff you have on the American Saw co site.&quot;</description>

            <title>Eleven Grooved Box Step by Step - Part 1 and Part 2 by Jim Harvey</title>
            <description>I’ve made about a dozen of these now and will document the next batch here with photos. Most of the boxes I’ve made lately are in Cherry or Walnut and are pencil box size, 3″ x 8″. These next few will be larger, sized to hold 3″ x 5″ index cards.
&lt;br /&gt;
The lumber for this project is leftover tongue and groove wainscoat paneling from my fathers house circa 1974. These were milled 5″ wide and 11/16″ thick. He never finished the basement so after 35 years, some of the stock was available. The Cherry had darkened quite a bit and that had to be planed off to get an even color on both sides of the boards.</description>

            <title>The Eleven Grooved Box – Tools Set Up by Jim Harvey</title>
            <description>I am a big fan of Roy Underhill’s “The Woodwright’s Shop”. Last fall was the 32nd season, and he’s still wearing the same hat. 

The second episode was titled “The Eleven Grooved Box”, a project Roy uses in his woodworking school. You can see it here. 

I was attracted to this project because he uses Stanley 45 combination planes to make all eleven grooves. 

I have a Stanley 45 and have been looking for an appropriate project so I am trying to duplicate what Roy does as closely as I can.</description>

            <title>Dovetail Saws Put to the New Tools Test by Peter Sefton</title>
            <description>Needing to equip seven student toolboxes with dovetail saws, Peter Sefton and his latest crop of budding furniture makers test eight of the best saws from Britain and beyond, with surprising results.&lt;br /&gt;
When new students come and join me at the workshop, the initial few days concentrate on tool selection, sharpening, fettling and general care of both new and existing tools. We also discuss in detail buying new kit, which for most tools is quite straightforward but I always find the Dovetail saw the most tricky to advise upon.</description>

            <title>Setting up a Cap Iron by Bill Rittner</title>
            <description>When fettling a plane for the first time a lot of attention is usually paid to the iron, or blade, and rightfully so.&lt;br /&gt;
 It&apos;s because no matter what else you do to a plane if the iron is not sharp the plane won’t function at its best.&lt;br /&gt;
The next most important part in the process is the cap iron, commonly known as the chip breaker.</description>

            <title>Greyhound Panel Saw No. 8 - 20&quot;, 11ppi, crosscut by Daryl Weir</title>
            <description>Here&apos;s a good example of a late 1890&apos;s to 1900 &quot;Golden Era&quot; George Bishop No. 8, 20&quot; panel saw with a very fine 11ppi crosscut configuration. &lt;br /&gt;
With it&apos;s cover top &amp; let-in handle, this saw was meant to directly compete with Disston&apos;s D8 saw at that time. Unfortunately, Bishop&apos;s No. 8 saws show up far less often than the D8.&lt;br /&gt;
Saws of 24 inches and smaller panel sized saws seem to be a little harder to come by than their bigger full size 26&quot; counterparts.</description>

            <title>Quick half-blind dovetails... the hard part by Zach Dillinger</title>
            <description>If you want to make realistic reproductions, don&apos;t listen to the modern nonsense that every surface is a show surface. &lt;br /&gt;
Period furniture (i.e. when things were done by hand with speed) shows many tool marks. A large number of 18th century furniture pieces I have studied exhibit deep saw overcuts on the drawer fronts. &lt;br /&gt;
Some of these extend an inch beyond the baseline and are quite deep into the face of the drawer. They aren&apos;t simply to release the outside corner as some posit... they are far deeper than required for that task.</description>

            <title>Woodrough &amp; McParlin Handsaw No. 55 Bow Belly by Daryl Weir</title>
            <description>I took a chance bidding on this one on eBay as it had quite a few broken teeth, about 30 in all when it got to my door! &lt;br /&gt;
I was the only one that bid on it as most figured it was probably a lost cause with the number of teeth gone in the pictures. I figured it was a No.55 Bow Belly by the handle shape and the plated hardware.&lt;br /&gt;
I couldn&apos;t even see an etch when I got the saw as the blade was covered in a pretty heavy dark brown to black rust. Here are a few pictures from eBay that shows the condition.</description>

            <description>I was poking around one of my favorite junk shops a few years ago , and to my delight stumbled upon on old miter box.&lt;br /&gt;
It was rusty and missing quite a few parts, but it had a nice saw with it and good bones. For some unknown reason I did not take a picture of it when I got it, but it was rough! &lt;br /&gt;
I cleaned all the rust off, repainted the main castings, and replaced as many parts as I could find.</description>

            <description>Geo. H. Bishop was proud to say about his saws that they should cut with... &quot;Speed &amp; Ease&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
Here is a good user grade saw, 1900 era Atkins &quot;SILVER STEEL&quot; No.53. It&apos;s a massive rip saw with the 28&quot; long blade.  Lets see how it cuts...&lt;br /&gt;
The edge has a very good crowning breast to it, just like the day it left the Atkins plant in Indianapolis. The edge did have some dings in it which I have worked out to the best of my ability. While I&apos;m not going to say it&apos;s pin straight, it&apos;s usable straight or I wouldn&apos;t be selling it.</description>

            <title>Channel Moldings by Zach Dillinger</title>
            <description>Channel moldings are commonly seen on seventeenth and early eighteenth century furniture.&lt;br /&gt;
They are very simple to do, yet add a nice shadow line that helps to break up an otherwise plain surface, which in this case is the four side rails for my poly chrome bevel molded dresser.&lt;br /&gt;
The channel molding is made up of a groove with molded features flanking either side of the groove. Ovolos, cavettos, ogees, and simple roundovers are seen.  These are usually done with a scratch stock and can be done after assembly if so desired.</description>

            <description>Sometime around 1915 Geo. H. Bishop company introduced a saw designed for a toolbox.&lt;br /&gt;
They named it a Bishop&apos;s Bulldog Toolbox Saw.&lt;br /&gt;
According to advertisements, the reason to this specialized type of saw was series of laws enacted to improve safety of surroundings when tools are in transport.</description>

            <description>In this age of fine hardwood floors and beautiful interior finish, the saw plays an important part. &lt;br /&gt;
The carpenter or workman needs a saw that will do the work accurately and quickly and without the aid of other tools to start the job with. The accompanying illustration shows the new floor saw that Geo. H. Bishop &amp; Co. are placing on the market. One glance at the illustration will tell our readers what this new saw should accomplish&lt;br /&gt;
 The reputation of the manufacturers is back of this saw guaranteeing that it will do everything it should, and live up - in quality and workmanship - to the Greyhound trademark placed upon every saw blade.</description>

            <title>How do you know when your tools are sharp? by Zach Dillinger</title>
            <description>The necessity of having a sharp chisel or plane iron with which to do your work is almost universally recognized (a very rare thing in the world of woodworking!). &lt;br /&gt;
Sure, you can muddle through a job with half-sharp tools, but sooner or later a dull-ish tool will negatively impact your work (or your finger!) as you try to force the tool to do work for which it is not prepared.</description>

            <description>Some years ago in the early summer I found a guy on Craigslist getting rid of a bunch of old tools and decided to go check them out. I ended up getting a little cache of nice things, my favorite of which was a sweet gem of a saw that I noticed sticking out of the bottom of a box of rust. &lt;br /&gt;
All I could make out in the darkness of this guys basement was the finely shaped upper horn of a small back saw but that was enough for me. &lt;br /&gt;
I quickly fell in love with it and took it home despite its sorry condition. Here she was as found...</description>

            <title>One of the better curly apple handles I&apos;ve seen... - Simonds Handsaw No. 5 by Daryl Weir</title>
            <description>A few figured apple handles come along once in a while on vintage saws but for the most part are few and far between. This has got to be one of the better ones I&apos;ve seen and the pictures really don&apos;t do it justice.&lt;br /&gt;
It is installed on a late 1900 early 1910 era Simonds No.5, which is similar in looks to the Disston No.12, but not near as common. The original owner must have treasured it enough to scribe his name on the back side close to the handle.</description>

            <title>Swan Double-stamped Bench Chisel - 12 inch long, 1-3/4&quot; wide - James Swan Co.</title>
            <description>In 1865 Mr. Swan was hired as superintendent of the Douglass Manufacturing Company in Seymour, CT. The company was involved in manufacturing of augers and bits. After 12 years with James Swan purchased the plant in Seymour and in 1877 established his own entity - James Swan Company.&lt;br /&gt;
The chisel shown below was produced at the time of ownership change and carries two different stamps – Douglass Mfg. Co. and James Swan Co.</description>

            <description>During late 1890s the Arcade File Works, located in Anderson, IN, advertised heavily in the trade publications. A series of uniquely designed advertisements were placed in the Machinery magazine during 1899.  &lt;br /&gt;
These were a full page advertisements designed in a form of a &quot;how to&quot; articles, discussing various way that files should be used and care for.  The advertisement shown here talks about files care.</description>

            <title>Plane Bevel Ups and Downs - with Paul Sellers</title>
            <description>A plane skims off many years of developed change and transforms roughness in touch to smoothness and the shapeless to shaped. It&apos;s hard to convey the impression a cutting edge brings to wood even though we live surrounded by its impact. &lt;br /&gt;
Millions of trillions of cuts undulate on the surfaces of wood around the world and we walk unconsciously by them. &lt;br /&gt;
I&apos;ve made millions of them myself using planes hundreds of years old and new.</description>

            <title>Oh, please make your mind up, Mr. Berg! by Kim Malmberg</title>
            <description>It was one of those late workshop evenings. The house was silent, I should have been fast asleep in my bed, but I was enjoying the moment and was rummaging around for a suitable cutter for an ongoing project. &lt;br /&gt;
I had been experimenting with adding thick vintage cutters to metal hand planes, and I was particularly looking for a 2 inch Erik Anton Berg cutter of good length. It turned out I had several so I started comparing them.</description>

            <description>The question has been asked by somebody, How old are trade-marks?&quot; who answers it by saying that they seem to be nearly as old as the industry of the race.&lt;br /&gt;
For instance: Ancient Babylon had property symbols, and the Chinese claim to have had trade-marks 1,000 years before Christ. Guttenberg, the very inventor of printing, had a lawsuit about a trade-mark, and he won it.</description>

            <title>Bench Plane - How it&apos;s Made...</title>
            <description>The various surfacing planes are nearly alike, as regards the arrangement of the iron, the principal differences being in their magnitudes. &lt;br /&gt;
Thus the maximum width is determined by the average strength of the individual, and the difficulty of maintaining with accuracy the rectilinear edge. &lt;br /&gt;

As an ex-Army competitive shooter who is now a volunteer coach for a large junior program teaching Olympic small-bore, I’m constantly looking for ways to reduce the distractions and inefficiencies of match preparation, and getting the rifle off the ground to speed buttplate and sight adjustments is an excellent example.</description>

            <description>1874 was a very busy year at the Keystone Saw Works, the hub of Henry Disston and Sons mammoth saw and tool making enterprise. &lt;br /&gt;
Among many patents granted that year and utilized on new Disston saws was the ‘Improvement in handles for saws’ feature granted to William J. Reagan on December 8. The Reagan patent handle was found on the Disston No. 9 improved backsaw, which featured a decorative ogee shaped on the nose of the saw blade, as well as the standard Disston #4 backsaw with a square nose.</description>

Here&apos;s a little side note for the saw purchaser to look for: there is usually a 1 ppi graduation on 5 1/2 ppi and coarser rips saws and it is something one needs to always look for.</description>

            <title>The Care, Selection and Proper Fitting of Hand Saws by Charles Johnson, 1909</title>
            <description>During 1905 and 1904 the writer was Engineer for Porter Brothers of Spokane, on their contracts in connection with the construction of the Puget Sound Power Company&apos;s Plant at Electron, Washington.
One of the contracts called for the construction oi e box flume 8 feet square. The work of building 8-l/2 miles of this flume was sublet to the Northwest Bridge Company of Tacoma.&lt;br /&gt;
The bottom of the flume was double, being made of 2 inch plank lined with l inch stuff. The flume was built on true circular curves, the sides being sprung to place. The last board on each side of the bottom, both of the main floor and the lining had to be scribed to fit the sides and then ripped. After several unsuccessful attempts to do this work with power saws it was decided to do it by hand.</description>

            <description>There is nothing more confusing to the young mechanic than the use of the several systems of gauges used in designating the sizes of wire, machine screws, drills and plate thickness. Unfortunately, most of these dimensions differ from each other for corresponding numbers by comparatively small amounts, yet an amount sufficient to cause error if the one is mistaken for the other. &lt;br /&gt;
The following table gives for comparison values for only a few numbers under each of the several gauges in most common use.</description>

            <description>This is a historically significant Jackson 10&quot; back saw made by Disston. It&apos;s from the mid to later part of the 1870 period. The dating is based on screws used to fasten the handle. These are small thread diameter, Disston centennial screws.&lt;br /&gt;
They were patented by Henry Disston and featured domed head and a capped nut that covered the end of the male-end of the screw.</description>

            <title>Decoding Smith’s ‘Key’ by Matthew Cianci</title>
            <description>Joseph Smith was an English engraver working around the turn of the 18th century, and he is noted as having produced one of the Western world’s first tool catalogs, called formally, ‘Explanation or key, to the various manufactories of Sheffield, with engravings of each article’. &lt;br /&gt;
He was not a tool maker, or dealer, as far as we can tell (Kebabian, 1975), and he was not a cabinet maker, joiner, or even a woodworker. Quite ironic then, that his work stands as perhaps the one of the most important historical records of the tools of period woodworkers.</description>

            <title>Hand Saw Re-work by Will Myers</title>
            <description>My favorite hand saws are the older ones, particularly the ones made later in the 19th and early 20th centuries.&lt;br /&gt;
In my opinion this was the golden age of the handsaw. The blades were taper ground of good quality steel, the totes were shapely, looked nice, and were actually made to fit a human hand. There are still plenty of these saws around but are getting more expensive and a bit more scarce. &lt;br /&gt;
The saws made after these in the later 1900’s turn up quite often and are usually cheap. Most of these have good quality blades but the totes look and fit you hand terrible. I usually pass these saws up because totes will almost give you a blister just looking at them.</description>

            <title>Hand Drill No. 2A Transitional by Wiktor Kuc</title>
            <description>The hand drill No. 2A was introduced by Millers Falls Company around 1957.(1)  My collection of catalogs does not go beyond 1949, consequently the description of this drill is based on data from the catalog released by Millers Falls Tool Co., an entity organized in 1982.  &lt;br /&gt;
The Ingersoll-Rand Company, the owner of Millers Falls Company prior to 1982, sold all hand tool business to this new entity.  The description and image below is from the catalog published by this new organization - a Millers Falls Tool Co.&lt;br /&gt;
Major differences between this 1857 model and preceding 1938 edition are in the type of metal used for the frame, casting method of the frame, the size and appearance of the frame, and the spindle diameter.

The No. 2 drill released in 1938 and produced until 1857, (the introduction year of No. 2A) is made of malleable, sand-cast iron later machined to affect a few areas of the frame.</description>

            <title>Stainless Cutlery and the History of Portland Works in Sheffield by Geoffrey Tweedale</title>
            <description>In 2013, Sheffield celebrated an important centenary – the discovery of stainless steel for cutlery. The anniversary was duly marked by various events, exhibitions, and publications. It was an opportunity to reflect on the individuals and companies involved in this revolutionary breakthrough.&lt;br /&gt;
The steel and cutlery firms that shaped the introduction of stainless steel a hundred years ago have long since disappeared. Indeed - although one hardly dare whisper it - Sheffield no longer manufactures forged table-knife blades (though a handful of firms, it is true, continue to market cutlery). However, factory buildings last longer than people.</description>

            <title>Tweedale&apos;s Directory of Sheffield Cutlery – 2nd Edition by Wiktor Kuc</title>
            <description>The 2nd edition of Tweedale’s Directory of Sheffield Cutlery Manufacturers, 1740 - 2013, by Geoffrey Tweedale covers about 1600 enterprises, active within that time period. &lt;br /&gt;
These dates are significant. The year 1740 marks the beginning of the commercial production of crucible steel and 2013 marks the centenary of the discovery of stainless steel for the production of cutlery (and tools).</description>

            <title>Filing a Lamb’s Tongue... by Matthew Cianci</title>
            <description>So I recently acquired a nice old Disston #7 in need of a handle from one of my Woodnet connections (Thanks Dave!) &lt;br /&gt;
Judging from the medallion and etch, which is clearly visible, I’d say it dates from just before the turn of the century.&lt;br /&gt;
Prior to my taking possession, it seems that the previous owner out of spite, or perhaps a sick sense of humor, installed a tote on this poor old saw that more resembled an oven mit than a device to comfortably operate and control the saw blade. Thankfully though the devious bastard did at least retain the original nuts and said medallion in the installation.</description>

            <title>Stanley Plane Restoration by Will Myers</title>
            <description>I enjoy making a useless tool useful again. Old Stanley hand planes are always fun to restore.&lt;br /&gt;
They are plentiful, low cost and can be made into a magnificent tool with a little time and effort. These planes are well documented, it is easy to find the age and changes made thru their production history at sites like Patricks’ Blood &amp; Gore and Hyperkitten has an excellent plane dating flowchart on his website if you are curious about a Stanley plane you have.</description>

            <title>Last Minute Shoptime by Darrell LaRue</title>
            <description>Ordinary people do a lot of last minute shopping.  Some Galoots do a lot of last minute shoptime.  &lt;br /&gt;
One of them is me. &lt;br /&gt;
I rummaged through some boxes of off-cuts out in the shed this morning. It was a bit of a chore just getting to the shed, as the ice storm we had last night froze the gate shut, and I had to clamber over the fence to get into the back yard, and then hammer the ice off the shed door to get in.</description>

            <description>The Pistolet modèle An XIII in .69 caliber represents the service pistol of choice during the Napoleonic era and was fielded by French cavalry as well as other army units and also naval personnel. &lt;br /&gt;
Approximately 300,000 were manufactured at the Royal Armories of St. Etienne, Maubeuge, and Charleville between 1806 and 1814. It was kept in service well into the 1840s when many were converted to percussion.</description>

            <title>A saw for Peter by Matthew Cianci</title>
            <description>Last winter I took a day off of work and hung out with Peter Follansbee at his shop at Plimoth Plantation.&lt;br /&gt;
Peter and I had become friendly through the Lie-Nielsen Hand Tool Events around New England, and I had sharpened a couple of saws for him. In the course of talking tools and shop, Peter showed me his saws. One of them was a nice 14 inch backsaw that he used occasionally for bench work like cutting tenon shoulders. I asked him how he liked it, and he said that he had some difficulty using it and that it was a bit uncomfortable.</description>

            <title>The Sharp Priorities… by Matthew Cianci</title>
            <description>When it comes to teaching saw sharpening, I generally recommend students follow a hierarchy while developing their skills.&lt;br /&gt;
By suggesting where to focus their attention first, it helps new filers get their saws sharp and cutting true with the shortest learning curve.&lt;br /&gt;
First, make sure all of the teeth are the same height. Jointing the saw before sharpening creates a visual “flat” on each tooth that guides this process. File until the flat is gone, but not a micro-spec further.</description>

            <title>Shaker-inspired Bookcase - part 2 by Will Myers</title>
            <description>The two doors are the next thing to make. These doors are made from 7/8 in stock that was clear and as straight grained as possible.&lt;br /&gt;
I cut the stiles a bit longer than needed so as to leave a little extra on the ends to help keep from spitting them when chopping the end mortises.&lt;br /&gt;
I clamped the four door stiles together and laid out the length of the doors and the rail locations first. Next, I laid out the length of the mortises for each of the three rails; by clamping all four stiles together for the layout assures both doors are identical to one another and the mortises line up perfectly.</description>

            <title>Making a Modified D-23 Replica Disston Hand Saw by Joe DiPietro</title>
            <description>My wanting to make this replica began several years ago. The first saw I’d ever touched occurred 55 years past in my mom and dad’s shop—and that was a skewback D-20, crosscut saw.&lt;br /&gt;
Even as little as I was, I was drawn to the shape of it’s tote (no, I didn’t know the term for the handle was “tote” then); but I watched as Dad used it, I clearly recall how Dad’s “ballet” of using it mesmerized me.</description>

            <description>I teach hand cut dovetails and the students use my chisels to chop out the waste. So after each class, I have to go through my chisels and sharpen the ones the students used.&lt;br /&gt;
Over the years, I&apos;ve tried different techniques for sharpening and have settled on a technique which I find to be fast and produces an excellent edge.&lt;br /&gt;
I use certain equipment in the sharpening process, and while some of it is expensive, it&apos;s generally a once in a lifetime purchase.</description>

One of several highlights of the day was when Mark pulled out some old saws that had been in the museum’s collection for a while. He knew nothing about them.</description>

As soon as the wood inside the ferrule has cooked enough, you can pull the blade out with your fingers.&lt;br /&gt;
You don&apos;t have to heat the shaft, and if you like you can wrap it with a wet cloth during the ferrule heating.</description>

Louis cubes are named for Louis XIV of France because the cubes were popular on furniture during his reign. But the cubes go back much further in antiquity.</description>

My book hunting routine is starting to get old. My lovely wife who is a very organized person is also getting tired of my little book problem too. I have been thinking about bookcase building for a while, but had not decided on what to build.</description>

            <title>Disassemble a Yankee Pushdrill by James D. Thompson</title>
            <description>I recently acquired a Yankee push drill which didn&apos;t want to function properly. I think it is a #41, but someone thought it proper to take the tool to a grinder and grind off the surface of the marked part of the barrel. I am going to presume that this was done to obliterate some owner&apos;s mark. I buffed up the damage a little so it wouldn&apos;t be quite so ugly.&lt;br /&gt;
I wanted to disassemble this beast to give it a good cleaning and oiling, but I could find no information on the internet that was useful. So I did what any good Galoot would do, I went at it in blissful ignorance. But I did take pictures, and I&apos;ll tell you how to do it. Here is a picture of the tool disassembled.</description>

            <description>I just finished a new vise. But really this vise is 40 years old. Or rather, parts of it are 40 years old. &lt;br /&gt;
Back when rocks were squishy, I was young and poor (still poor just not young anymore) I realized I needed a vise in the worst way. I was just starting out. I had nothing. Vises weren&apos;t exactly falling from the rooftops. &lt;br /&gt;
I grabbed some big all-thread and a scrap of 2X8. I put together something in a couple of days, which is fast considering I was coming from nowhere. It was my main and only vise and I didn&apos;t know any better.</description>

            <title>A Real Fish Story by Kim Malmberg</title>
            <description>Most woodworkers will recognize the tool maker Erik Anton Berg of Eskilstuna, Sweden. The Berg brand is well know across the globe.&lt;br /&gt;
Most people would also be able to recognize the Berg tools simply by their logo, an outlined shark.&lt;br /&gt;
Or, was it a fish? Actually, it was both.&lt;br /&gt;
No, it wasn&apos;t a genetic manipulation. It wasn&apos;t both at the same time. But when Erik Anton Berg started the company he chose a fish as the company logo, more specifically a Wels catfish, also known as sheatfish. The latin name is Sirulus Glanis.</description>

            <title>Wedgearm Plow Planes - a Second Look by Jason Stamper</title>
            <description>As I began getting into more traditional woodworking, and reading a lot of stuff about what tools to get, I decided that I needed a plow plane. &lt;br /&gt;
So, I went into research mode and tried to find out what I should buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

 A lot of the books I was reading talked about the fancy screw arm wooden planes, which were often said to be the most decorated and coveted tools in a workman’s tool chest.</description>

            <title>The secrets they tell us... by Matthew Cianci</title>
            <description>I think our tools have secrets to tell us if we are keen enough to listen to them. This is one of the reasons why I almost always prefer antique tools over new ones.&lt;br /&gt;
Not to say that new tools don’t have secrets - quite the contrary.</description>

            <title>Cabinet for Marquetry Trays - Part 3 by P. Michael Henderson</title>
            <description>This is a continuation of the build of the cabinet for the marquetry trays and covers the making of the marquetry for the front of the cabinet.&lt;br /&gt;
I&apos;m making progress on the marquetry design. I&apos;m not finished yet, but I have enough to be able to lay out the front of the cabinet.</description>

            <title>Re-casting Rings on a John Fray (Spofford) Brace by Will Myers</title>
            <description>The Spofford style brace is by far my favorite bit brace. &lt;br /&gt;
They are so simple yet so perfect. You can change bits with a quick twist of the wing nut, Spofford’s are also lighter weight than most braces. &lt;br /&gt;
The Spofford chuck was patented in 1859. John S. Fray &amp; Company started making these braces the same year, Stanley bought out Fray in 1920 and continued to produce them into the 1940’s.&lt;br /&gt;
Being as simple as they are there is no too much to go wrong with them. One problem I have noticed on a lot of them is the pewter rings that hold the handle halves together are either loose or broken. I think the rings are a nice detail on these braces and decided to figure out a way to fix them. I had a couple of braces that needed the rings repaired; here is what I came up with.</description>

            <title>Making a Thin Lathe Skew by James D. Thompson</title>
            <description>All the skews I have bought have been at least 1/4” thick. &lt;br /&gt;
I thought I was sharpening them correctly, but obviously, I was not. I recently came across a thin skew, and it changed my life. &lt;br /&gt;
I decided to make one. I used a piece of High Speed Steel power hacksaw blade, It is about 1” wide and 3/32&apos; thick. I cut piece about 6” long and ground off the teeth.</description>

            <title>A Little Box by Will Myers</title>
            <description>Mr. Webster’s definition of a box is: a rigid typically rectangular container with or without a cover.&lt;br /&gt;
Small boxes are always an enjoyable project. They do not require much material and if you keep it fairly simple they do not take long to make. Finding a use for them is never a problem either. &lt;br /&gt;
If you like to cut dovetails they are excellent practice projects; if you make a bad mistake all you need is another scrap of wood to make a replacement piece.</description>

            <title>My 1830&apos;s Plated English Bit Brace by Jason Stamper</title>
            <description>Here is my 1830&apos;s plated English bit brace. Most likely manufactured by Henry Brown after he bought out James Bee.&lt;br /&gt;
The body is beech with a lignum top pad. Also, I wanted to share 2 countersink bits including one rare Abbott bit, patent from 1871. Thanks for watching and feel free to comment or ask questions!</description>
