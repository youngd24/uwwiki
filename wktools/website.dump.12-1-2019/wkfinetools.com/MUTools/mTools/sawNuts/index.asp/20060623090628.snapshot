				<p align="left" style="text-indent: 30px">The screws and nuts 
				that hold a saw handle onto its blade are getting to be either 
				hard to find, or are exceedingly expensive. The standard issue 
				nuts from the hardware store are simple plated steel, and are 
				not consistent in length in my experience. The brass split nuts 
				are available, but are limited in supply and quite expensive at 
				about $5 each plus shipping at the time of this writing. </p>
				<p align="left" style="text-indent: 30px">I 
				thought to myself that I could make them almost as well using a 
				few simple tools found in most woodworking shops - and then I 
				would be able to claim that the saws I make are made entirely by 
				myself, something I thought would be kind of cool to be able to 
				do.</p>
				<h5 align="left">Materials and Tools required</h5>
				<p align="left" style="text-indent: 30px">The split nuts 
				themselves will be manufacture from 10-24 (or 10-32) threaded 
				brass rod (1&quot; long, from McMaster Carr) and plain 9/16&quot; brass 
				rod (9/16&quot; is a common size on most saws with split nuts, but 
				I've also seen 1/2&quot; used), both available from good metal 
				suppliers online (such as McMaster Carr or MSC Direct). Tools 
				needed are a hacksaw, a drill press, a 10-24 (or 10-32) TPI tap, 
				a disk or belt sander, and finally a grinder outfitted with a 
				de-burring and buffing wheel. A jig for making the nuts will be 
				crafted out of some 8/4 ash, some 1/8&quot; plate steel, and a 
				threaded insert.</p>
				<p align="left" style="text-indent: 30px">To make the bolts, a 
				torch (along with all the necessary accoutrements) is necessary 
				for silver-soldering the nut to the threaded brass. An 
				oxy-acetylene torch is the best tool for this job - however, 
				here I am use one of those $50 welding kits that use a small 
				bottle each of MAPP and oxygen gas. These small kits supply 
				plenty of heat for the job, and are much less expensive than 
				buying a full oxy-acetylene rig. If you do a lot of soldering, 
				this is not very cost efficient method - but for occasional use, 
				they works fine.</p>
				<p align="left" style="text-indent: 30px">You will also need 
				some silver solder and flux - I use a brand called &quot;Stay-Silv 
				45&quot; for the best results. This should be available at most good 
				welding supply stores.</p>
				<h5 align="left">A Simple Jig, and Making the &quot;Tube&quot;</h5>
				<p align="left" style="text-indent: 30px">What's needed first is 
				a way to drill a hole through the center of the brass rod in 
				order to thread the nut. The hole must be sized for the size 
				thread you want to tap, and centered in the rod to be proper. 
				The only way to do this is to build a simple jig to hold the 
				brass rod upright so the hole can be drilled into it's center. 
				You will see the jig in many of the following pictures here, and 
				I won't go into too much detail on it because of it's 
				simplicity.</p>
				<p align="left" style="text-indent: 30px">Using a forstner bit 
				that's the size rod you are using, I drill a vertical hole into 
				some 8/4 ash, not all the way through, leaving about 1/2&quot; of 
				wood at the bottom so the rod won't fall through. I then pick a 
				spot on it's side near the top and drill an additional 3/8&quot; hole 
				from the side, centered on the previous hole. Into this hole I 
				insert a threaded insert - this will allow me to use a small 
				bolt to &quot;lock&quot; the brass rod in place, so it doesn't turn in the 
				hole while drilling it.</p>
				<p align="left" style="text-indent: 30px">A small piece of steel 
				mounted on the side of the ash was added when the threaded 
				insert I used started wanting to strip out of the wood - the 
				steel is there simply to hold the threaded insert in place in 
				its hole.</p>
				<p align="left" style="text-indent: 30px">Once the jig is 
				complete, I take a 7&quot; or 8&quot; section of brass rod, and insert it 
				into the jig. Using a center finder, I locate the center of the 
				rod and use a center punch on it to locate it for the drill bit. 
				I place the entire assembly on the drill press, and drill a 
				13/64&quot; hole in the center of the brass rod to the drill bits 
				full depth:</p>
				<p><img border="0" src="images/image001.jpg"></p>
				<p align="left" style="text-indent: 30px">Drilling it to the 
				full depth of the drill bit is necessary for the next step, 
				which is tapping the hole for 10-24 thread.</p>
				<h5 align="left" style="text-indent: 30px"><br>
				Making the Nut</h5>
				<p style="text-indent: 30px" align="left">The next step is to 
				tap the brass rod using a 10-24 tpi tap:</p>
				<p><img border="0" src="images/image002.jpg"></p>
				<p align="left" style="text-indent: 30px">Tap to the full depth 
				of the tap - on subsequent nuts, it's occasionally necessary to 
				drill the center hole a little deeper to accommodate the tap.</p>
				<p align="left" style="text-indent: 30px">Now its time to add 
				the slot for the nut - you can skip this step if the nut is to 
				be used for the bolts. I use a hack saw to make the slot:</p>
				<p><img border="0" src="images/image003.jpg"></p>
				<p align="left" style="text-indent: 30px">Cut to a depth of 
				about 1/8&quot; to 3/16&quot; or so, making sure the cut is level across 
				the nut - then cut the nut off, making sure you make the cut as 
				straight as possible and about 3/16&quot; further down the nut than 
				the slot is deep:</p>
				<p><img border="0" src="images/image004.jpg"></p>
				<p align="left" style="text-indent: 30px">Set the new nut aside 
				and start the process over, making another then another until 
				you have as many nuts as you need.</p>
				<h5 align="left" style="text-indent: 30px"><br>
				Thicknessing and Polishing the Nut</h5>
				<p align="left" style="text-indent: 30px">You now have a rough 
				nut that is much too thick for use in a saw, and probably not 
				cut quite as square as it should be. To reduce the thickness and 
				level off the nut, cut the thread off of an 1-1/2&quot; long bolt 
				with the same threads, place 2 nuts ( locked together) near the 
				end (with about 1/8&quot; or so of thread sticking out of the 
				outermost nut) and chuck the affair into a hand drill. Thread 
				one of your newly made brass nuts onto the end of the whole 
				affair and bring it over to the disk sander. Use the drill to 
				spin the nut, and sand it to thickness:</p>
				<p><img border="0" src="images/image005.jpg"></p>
				<p align="left" style="text-indent: 30px">You have to ever so 
				slightly cant the assembly to the left to keep the brass nut 
				threaded onto its holder - otherwise the spin of the disk sander 
				will unthread it, sending it flying under the nearest bench and 
				into the most inaccessible spot it can find. When that side is 
				done, unthread the nut, flip it over, and do the other side in a 
				similar manner. Keep a pale of water handy to cool the nut so 
				you can grab it, because the brass gets hot! <br>
				Watch the depth of the slot cut into the nut and use it as a 
				guide - you want the slot to be about 1/2 the thickness of the 
				finished nut, which should be about 1/8&quot; to 3/16&quot; thick - I 
				shoot for exactly 5/32&quot; thick. You can put a slight chamfer on 
				the back of the nut, both for looks and so it seats itself 
				flatter in the wood when used in case there is sawdust in the 
				way. </p>
				<p align="left" style="text-indent: 30px">Once the nut is to the 
				correct thickness, a trip to the grinder where you have a 
				deburring and polishing wheel installed will give the nut a 
				finished polish: </p>
				<p><img border="0" src="images/image006.jpg"></p>
				<h5 align="left" style="text-indent: 30px">
				<span style="font-weight: 400">From here, its on to make the 
				corresponding bolt. I used the same slotted nuts for the bolt - 
				you may wish to use an un-slotted nut and make a shoulder for 
				your bolt. If that is the case, you can make those by using the 
				same process above only eliminating the slotting step above.</span>
				<br>
				<br>
				Making the Bolt</h5>
				<p align="left" style="text-indent: 30px">If you choose to use a 
				shoulder, one can be constructed out of brass bar - simply drill 
				a hole in some brass bar that is the width of the shoulder you 
				desire, cut it to length so it will work as a shoulder, with 
				maybe a final filing to shape. I used a 10-24 square steel nut, 
				soldered onto the brass rod just below the brass nut: <br>
				Anyway, I thread a nut onto the end of some threaded brass rod, 
				and cut it off at just over 1&quot; in length: </p>
				<p><img border="0" src="images/image007.jpg"></p>
				<p align="left" style="text-indent: 30px">Another option is to 
				buy the threaded brass rod in 1&quot; lengths, then there is no need 
				to cut them... </p>
				<p align="left" style="text-indent: 30px">I then silver-solder 
				the nut onto the brass threaded rod using a torch, some flux, 
				and some silver-solder:</p>
				<p><img border="0" src="images/image008.jpg"></p>
				<p align="left" style="text-indent: 30px">The threaded rod sticks a little past the nut, 
				so it's back to the sander to level it off with the nut, using 
				an additional nut on the same threaded rod assembly still 
				chucked up in the drill. If you did it all right, it should run 
				true:</p>
				<p><img border="0" src="images/image009.jpg"></p>
				<p align="left" style="text-indent: 30px">Then its back to the de-burring and polishing 
				wheel to clean up the face of the nut - you can see some 
				assembled bolts in this mess:</p>
				<p><img border="0" src="images/image010.jpg"></p>
				<p align="left" style="text-indent: 30px">At this point, the 
				split nuts and bolts are complete and ready for installation 
				into your new saw.&nbsp; If you drill the hole to the proper depth, 
				little filing should be necessary - you will need to file and 
				polish some on the nut side of the saw for sure, however - as 
				the bolt will undoubtedly protrude beyond the nut somewhat.<p>
				<img border="0" src="images/image011.jpg"><p align="left" style="text-indent: 30px">
				Here's the face of the bolts, installed in the same saw as the 
				photo above:<p><img border="0" src="images/image012.jpg"><p align="left" style="text-indent: 30px">
				When assembling, a little Loctite Threadlocker will also help to 
				hold the nut in place, but I've not found it necessary.<h5 align="left">
				Summary</h5>
				<p align="left" style="text-indent: 30px">While these were made 
				for new saws, there's no reason this same technique can't be 
				adapted to make replacement nuts and bolt for vintage screws.<p align="left" style="text-indent: 30px">
				Another fun little project!
